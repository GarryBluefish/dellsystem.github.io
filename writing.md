I started writing in earnest in late 2017, mostly about tech (see [Recent writing](#recent)).

Before that, my writing is pretty scattered and is mostly technical (programming-related). It's all listed here for data-hoarding/archival purposes, though I wouldn't recommend actually reading any of it:

* [Academic papers](/papers) resulting from my undergraduate research work
* A fairly pointless piece on predicting the 2016 elections for [Data Driven Journalism](http://datadrivenjournalism.net/featured_projects/endorsementdb_predicting_the_u.s._election_without_polls), from when I was a clueless liberal
* [Medium posts](/medium) from back when no one was willing to publish me (though I still like this [spicy piece on Paul Graham](https://medium.com/@dellsystem/paul-graham-blocked-me-on-twitter-c28ca647c7f8))
* Posts on my [personal blog](/blog) (mostly technical) stretching back the full 7 years of this website
