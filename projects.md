projects:
- [['phpBB', 'phpbb'], "phpBB is a popular open source bulletin board system written, shockingly, in PHP. I've been a moderator since October 2007 and a website team member since July 2011, and am currently working on several MODifications, the details of which can be found [here](phpbb)."]
- [['wikinotes', 'http://www.wikinotes.ca'], "A free, unofficial wiki-based resource for the courses at McGill University. As one of the admins, I'm working on improving the quality of the content, redesigning the site and moving from MediaWiki to Django (a beta is available at [beta.wikinotes.ca](http://beta.wikinotes.ca), with the source [on github](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/wikinotes)). The site can be found at [www.wikinotes.ca](http://www.wikinotes.ca)."]
- [['ssuns', 'https://www.github.com/juliusrain'], "As the 2011 USG-IT for this high school model UN conference at McGill, I redesigned the site and built a custom-tailored content management and registration system around phpBB. The source of the site is [available on github](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/ssuns-2011), and I'm planning on releasing the code for certain reusable features as independent MODs. The site is currently being managed by [juliusrain](https://www.github.com/juliusrain \"juliusrain is the best rain\")."]
- [['diva', 'http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/diva'], "An open source document viewer for high-resolution scanned documents, particularly music. Written as a jQuery plugin, with the source [available on github](https://www.github.com/DDMAL/diva.js). Spring of 2011 to present, for McGill's Department of Music Technology.

- [['networkdynamics', 'http://networkdynamics.org/'], "As a student researcher in the [Network Dynamics Lab](http://networkdynamics.org/) (part of McGill University's School of Computer Science), I write code, run experiments, and analyse data, mostly in the field of demographic inference with regard to Twitter. Most recently, I created the interface for [a visualisation of Christmas wishes on Twitter](http://xmas2012.networkdynamics.org); before that, I designed the interface for [an interactive visualisation of the 2012 US presidential election, in tweets](http://election.networkdynamics.org/)."]
