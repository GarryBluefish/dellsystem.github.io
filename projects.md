phpBB is a popular open source bulletin board system written, shockingly, in PHP. I've been a moderator and team member since October 2007, and am currently working on several MODifications.

An open source document viewer for high-resolution scanned documents, particularly music. Written as a jQuery plugin, with the source available on github. Spring of 2011 to present, for McGill's Department of Music Technology. Make a nice icon for it.

An unofficial open source wiki-based resource for the courses at McGill University. As one of the admins, I'm working on improving the quality of the content, redesigning the site and moving from MediaWiki to Django.

As the USG-IT for this Model UN conference at McGill, I redesigned the site and built a content management system around phpBB. The source of the site is [available on github](https://www.github.com/dellsystem/ssuns-2011); pull requests are welcomed.
