A sort of CMS-like MOD for phpBB. Still in the works. An example is running at [www.ssuns.org](http://www.ssuns.org).

## Features

*	Markdown support (may need to be phased out in favour of something else)
*	Custom template files
*	Pretty links (if there is mod_rewrite or whatever support)

### Planned

*	ACP-customisable menu
