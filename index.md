Below you can find some things I've recently written (you can find the rest

Want to ask me about any of my projects or just say hi? Send an email to
me@\[this domain\], or check out my [about page](/about#contact) for other contact
options. You could also take the opportunity to tell me how awesome I am,
but don't worry, I already know.
