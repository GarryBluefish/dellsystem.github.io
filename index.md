I'm Wendy Liu, and I currently live in London, where I speak and write about tech & politics from a socialist perspective.

Before I discovered "the left", I was a software engineer and startup founder (which I've written about for [Notes From Below](http://www.notesfrombelow.org/article/silicon-inquiry)).

This website is meant as a record of things I've done. Find me on Twitter ([@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem)) or email me (gmail: ilostwaldo).

## [Writing](/writing)

My primary outlets are [New Socialist](https://newsocialist.org.uk/author/wendy) (I co-edit the [economics section](https://newsocialist.org.uk/tag/economics)) and [Notes From Below](https://notesfrombelow.org/author/wendy-liu) (I'm the web editor). Other bylines include [Novara Media](https://novaramedia.com/), [New Internationalist](https://newint.org/), [Logic Magazine](https://logicmag.io/) and [Tribune](https://tribunemag.co.uk).

I also just finished a masters degree on inequality at the London School of Economics. I like sharing educational resources, so you can find my personal statement, copious lecture notes, essays and dissertation [here](/lse).

For a chronological list of nearly everything I've ever published, see [Writing](/writing).

## [Speaking](/speaking)

For a chronological list of my past & upcoming speaking appearances (podcasts, talks, panels, etc), see [Speaking](/speaking).

I'm currently not taking on any more speaking requests until the end of 2018.

## [Code](/code)

I've been coding for a while now, mostly in the realm of web dev (primarily backend). I no longer do it as a job, but I do manage some websites for UK left projects in my spare time: [New Socialist](https://newsocialist.org.uk), [The World Transformed](https://theworldtransformed.org/), [Notes From Below](https://www.notesfrombelow.org). Also see: [my GitHub](https://github.com/dellsystem), and a list of [coding projects I've worked on](/code). I'm not taking on any more projects at this time, sorry!

## Other

* **Jacobin reading group**: I started an informal reading group on contemporary left politics in London. [Details here](/reading-group).
