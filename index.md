I'm Wendy Liu, and I'm currently the CTO of [Macromeasures], a data science
startup that I co-founded after graduating from McGill University in 2014. In
September 2017, I'll be starting a [one-year masters program on inequality at
the London School of Economics and Political Science][personal statement]. It
may seem like a strange about-turn, and in some ways it is, but in other ways
it feels like the most rational and thoughtful decision I've made in a long
time.

In case you're wondering about the username: I have no affiliation with Dell
Inc; "dellsystem" is a just a throwaway username I chose when I was 12, when
I signed up for an account on phpbb.com so I could get support for my bulletin
board. The phpBB community turned out to be a gateway drug for open source
software and programming in general, and so the username kind of stuck with me.
I have since come to terms with "dellsystem" and will even answer to "dell".
