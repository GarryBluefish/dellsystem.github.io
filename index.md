I'm Wendy Liu, and I'm currently the CTO of [Macromeasures], a data science
startup that I co-founded after graduating from McGill University in 2014. In
September 2017, I'll be starting a [one-year masters program on inequality at
the London School of Economics and Political Science][personal statement]. It
may seem like a strange about-turn, and in some ways it is, but in other ways
it feels like the most rational and thoughtful decision I've made in a long
time.

In case you're wondering about the username: I have no affiliation with Dell
Inc; "dellsystem" is an unfortunate consequence of a decision I made when I was
12, when I signed up for an account on phpbb.com so I could get support for my
phpBB installation. Since I was using a Dell computer at the time,
"dellsystem" seemed like a reasonable choice for what I thought would be a
throwaway account. I was wrong about the throwaway part, as the phpBB community
turned out to be a gateway drug for open source software and programming in
general. I have since come to terms with the username "dellsystem" and will
even answer to "dell".
