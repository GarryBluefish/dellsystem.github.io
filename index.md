I'm Wendy Liu, and I am:

* doing an [MSc on economic inequality at the London School of Economics][lse]
  (I'm posting [my course notes here](/words#course))
* one of the economics editors for the [New Socialist][ns] (email
  economics@newsocialist.org.uk if you have a pitch!)
* a member of both [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org/)
  and [Momentum](http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/) despite being neither
  American nor British (solidarity etc)
* a huge fan of David Foster Wallace (I maintain [a list of his work](/dfw) and
  also built the website for [the annual conference][dfwconf])
* still recovering from [my 208-book reading challenge](http://dellsystem.me/posts/a-year-of-200-books) in 2017
  and thus trying to avoid Goodreads for a while ([add me tho][Goodreads])

I was:

* co-founder and CTO of a (now mostly defunct) [data science startup][Macromeasures]
* a software developer [who thought working at Google was all there was to look
  forward to in life][story]

This website is primarily a place to showcase my [art](/art), my [code](/code),
and my [words](/words). If you want to get in touch, find me on Twitter
