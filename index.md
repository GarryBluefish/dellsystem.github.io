I'm Wendy, and I'm an undergraduate Math and Computer Science student at
McGill University. You may know me as:

* Lead developer for and prolific contributor to [Wikinotes] (since 2010)
* Someone who occasionally gives tech talks for events or organisations like
  [ConFoo 2014][confoo_talk], [HackMcGill's Hack 101s][hack101_talks], and
  [PyLadies meetups][pyladies_talk] (you can find my slides on [speakerdeck],
  and their source on [GitHub][slides])
* Former website and moderator team member at [phpBB.com]
  (2007–2014)
* USG-IT for [SSUNS 2011], [McMUN 2013] and [McMUN 2014]
* Former webmaster for [McGill's Computer Taskforce][ctf] (2011–2012)
* Past developer of [diva.js] while working at [DDMAL] (2011–2012)
* Past developer of [Agora Octave] for the European Space Agency's "Summer of
  Code in Space" (2012)
* Former student researcher in the [Network Dynamics lab] (2011–2014)
* That person with the weird username who may or may not be sponsored by
  Dell (I wish)

Below you can find some things I've recently written (you can find the rest
under [archives](/archives)). You can also learn more [about me](/about) or
[about my projects](/projects).

Want to ask me about any of my projects or just say hi? Send me a message on
Twitter [@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem), or check out my [about
page](/about#contact) for other contact options. You could also take the
opportunity to tell me how awesome I am, but don't worry, I already know.

_(I'm not actually this egotistic in person, I swear)_
