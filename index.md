I'm Wendy Liu, and I am:

* in the midst of an [MSc on economic inequality at the London School of Economics][lse]
  (I'm posting [my course notes here](/words#course))
* one of the economics editors for [New Socialist][ns] (email
  economics@newsocialist.org.uk if you have a pitch!)
* a huge fan of David Foster Wallace (I maintain [a list of his work](/dfw) and
  also built the website for [the annual conference][dfwconf])
* still recovering from [my 208-book Goodreads reading challenge](http://dellsystem.me/posts/a-year-of-200-books) in 2017 ([add me tho][Goodreads])

I was:

* co-founder and original CTO of a [data science startup][Macromeasures] that
  has since been acquired
* a software developer [who thought working at Google was all there was to look
  forward to in life][story]

This website is primarily a place to showcase my [art](/art), my [code](/code),
and my [writing](/words). If you want to get in touch, find me on Twitter
