Hi! I'm Wendy, and I currently work at [Macromeasures], a data science startup
incubated at McGill University. You may know me as:

* That person who wrote a really snarky blog post about some questionable code
  in Desire2Learn, which hit #1 on Hacker News back in September 2013 (my 15
  minutes of fame ... nothing I've done since then has been noteworthy)
* Someone who occasionally gives tech talks for events or organisations like
  [ConFoo 2014][confoo_talk], [HackMcGill's Hack 101s][hack101_talks], and
  [PyLadies meetups][pyladies_talk] (you can find my slides on [speakerdeck],
  and their source on [GitHub][slides])
* That person with the weird username who may or may not be sponsored by
  Dell (I wish)
* Someone who tried for a really long Github commit streak but who fell off at
  [170 days][github]
* Past owner of various incredibly [frivolous.domains] (including that one),
  at least until I let them all expire

I also interned at Google's San Francisco office in the summer of 2013, working
as a developer on an internal data visualisation tool using Python and d3.js.

Below you can find some things I've recently written (you can find the rest
under [archives](/archives)). You can also learn more [about me](/about) or
[about my projects](/projects).

Want to ask me about any of my projects or just say hi? Send me a message on
Twitter [@dellsystem](https://twitter.com/dellsystem), or check out my [about
page](/about#contact) for other contact options. You could also take the
opportunity to tell me how awesome I am, but don't worry, I already know. &lt;3

_(I'm not actually this egotistical in person, I swear)_
