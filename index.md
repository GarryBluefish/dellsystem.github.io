I'm Wendy Liu, and I am, among other things, a software developer based in
Montreal.

Here's some more context on who I am and what I've done:

* In September 2013, I got my 15 minutes of fame when I wrote a really snarky
  (and regretfully so) [blog post][d2l] about some questionable code that I
  found in my university's learning management system, Desire2Learn. The blog
  post found its way to #1 on Hacker News while I was asleep, an incident that
  affirmed the merits of using a static site generator to build this website.
  Nothing I've done since then has been remotely noteworthy.
* In the past, I've given tech talks for events and organisations like
  [ConFoo 2014][confoo_talk], [HackMcGill's Hack 101s][hack101_talks], and
  [PyLadies meetups][pyladies_talk]. You can find my slides on [speakerdeck],
  and their source on [GitHub][slides].
* I have no affiliation with Dell Inc. The username "dellsystem" was an
  unfortunate consequence of a decision I made when I was 12, when I signed up
  for an account on phpbb.com so I could get support for my phpBB installation.
  Since I was using a Dell computer at the time, "dellsystem" seemed like a
  reasonable choice for what I thought would be a throwaway account. I was
  wrong about the throwaway part, as the phpBB community turned out to be a
  gateway drug for open source software and programming in general. I have
  since come to terms with the username "dellsystem" and will even answer to
  "dell".
* I interned at Google's San Francisco in the summer of 2013, working on an
  internal data visualisation tool using Python and d3.js.
* After graduating from McGill in 2014, I co-founded a data science startup
  called [Macromeasures] and have been slaving away at it ever since.

Below, you'll find excepts of my blog posts (you can view them as a list on the
[writing](/writing) page). If you want to get in touch, find me on Twitter
