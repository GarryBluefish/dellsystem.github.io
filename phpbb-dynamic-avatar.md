This MOD provides the ability to edit your avatar, using bodily features and clothes that can be purchased or acquired. In the vein of 2.0x MODs like Live Avatar and Nulavatar, and the dynamic avatar capabilities of the 3.0x MOD Camorea Suite. Useful for RPG forums.

Although not required, the Ultimate Points MOD by femu and Wuerzi is supported by this MOD. If you have it installed, you will be able to set prices for items. If not installed, all items are free.

Additionally, although some sample images are provided for you to test out the MOD, a comprehensive set of avatar and clothing images is not included; you will need to acquire those images yourself, hopefully legally.

*	Everything is controlled from the ACP
*	Users are genderfied
*	Items have gender - users can only don clothing items of their own gender (and unisex items)
*	Option to allow users to change their 'base' - that is, features like skin tone, eye color, etc - if the admin so wishes. Otherwise, this is only modifiable once: when the user is first creating the avatar
*	Items can be purchasable, if the points MOD is installed, or given away in a Salvation Army-like setup
*	Each user has an inventory (or 'wardrobe', as this MOD calls it), from which the user can choose the clothing items he/she wishes to wear
*	MOD includes sample images, layers and items for you to play with to get the hang of things.
