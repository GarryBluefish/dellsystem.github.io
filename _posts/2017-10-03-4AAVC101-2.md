### Readings

#### [Cognitive Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14803576-cognitive-capitalism) by Yann Moulier Boutang (chapter 3)

So I started reading this from the beginning and realised that I didn't just
want to read chapter 3, I wanted to read the whole book, which I didn't have
time to do just yet. Luckily, the reading is summarised quite nicely in the
lecture notes below.

#### [The Ecology of Attention](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30613224-the-ecology-of-attention) by Yves Citton (chapter 1)

Notes from the introduction:

* we're moving from an economy of **material goods** (governed by the scarcity
  of **the factors of production**) to an economy of **attention** (governed by
  the scarcity of **the capacity for the reception of cultural goods**)
* you can see the rise of advertising as a necessary consequence of the need to
  absorb excess goods coming from rising productivity (and thus excess
  production relative to needs)
* Herbert Simon is often thought of as the father of the attention economy (he
  introduced the term in a 1969 conference)
  * a wealth of information means a dearth of attention (our attention is, in
    fact, consumed by this information)
  * given where scarcity lies these days, content creators (authors, musicians,
    etc) should really be paying consumers for their attention, not the other
    way around
  * a spin on "if a product is free, then the real product is you": the real
    product is your attention
* given how much $ is in advertising, we know that our attention has a high
  price, but that price is not paid to us---in exchange, we receive at best a
  useful free service (Google, Twitter) and at worst a massive time sink that
  corrupts our minds and souls (Candy Crush, also Twitter)
* of course, the new attention economy won't ever _replace_ the material
  economy---that needs to keep existing underneath
* the trend of prescribing Ritalin as a way of increasing our attention span:
  you can see this as a way of reifying this (frankly stupid) assumption that
  we should have limitless attention spans
* three types of attention
  1. as a collective phenomenon (I am attentive to what we are collectively
  attentive to)
  2. within a dyadic relationship (I am attentive to what you are attentive to)
  3. as an individual (attention as a means of individuating the self, creating
  identity)
* we should try to break free of the economic paradigm of understanding
  attention, which even infests the way we talk about it ("paying" attention)
* there's a pretty trenchant critique of Hayek's liberal Great Society in which
  everyone can choose their own idea of happiness: "attentional processes are
  inextricably linked to our process of valorization", which results in a
  vicious/virtuous cycle as we value what we pay attention to and we pay
  attention to what we value (both as individuals and collectively)
* attention is an interaction, an essential mediator of our relationship with
  the environment around us; some degree of attention is needed just to survive

Chapter 1

* from the POV of an alien looking at earth (you can call this technique
  estrangement I think)
* we see lots of **communal valorization**---entire generations taking up the same
  (material) trends, primarily as the result of the mediasphere
  * in order for factories to sell the physical goods they've manufactured, the
    media itself must manufacture consumers
  * he coins the term **echosystem** to describe an infrastructure of
    resonances conditioning our attention and its circulation
  * our "freedom" is severely constrained by the media that conditions us and
    shapes even our most intimate thoughts
* because our attention is finite, we can never pay enough attention to be
  truly "rational" the way free market economists would imagine us to be
* there's a nice subtle critique of GDP as an indicator of prosperity here
  (cool related concept that I thought of afterwards, while typing this up:
  [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law),
  though I don't think the author uses that term here)
* 4 main attention regimes, according to Dominique Bouillier, which you can
  think of as the ends of axes on a Cartesian plane (not entirely sure
  why these are useful though, maybe that'll come later)
  * alertness: like popups; we perceive them as interruptions, nuisances,
    threats
  * loyalty: building a long-term relationship of trust and reliability (the
    opposite side of alertness)
  * projection: holding the environment at arms length and allowing you to
    apply existing models
  * immersion: being plunged into a new, strange, exotic environment and
    forcing you to stay vigilant in order to adapt

I now want to read this whole book too, which is a little concerning given that
I have so many other readings and (as I've been reminded by this book) only a
finite amount of attention.

Post-script: I have indeed read the whole book, and my notes are, as always,
on [Bookmarker](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/book/the-ecology-of-attention).

### Lecture

_(I missed the first few minutes because the room number was "S-1.06" and I
interpreted that as S DASH 1.06 and thus spent several stressful minutes around
a very empty first floor that was completely devoid of any classrooms and
asking everyone who passed by if they knew where the classroom was, to no
avail. Luckily I then noticed that there was a basement floor whose room
numbers were prefixed by S-1. I still think it's a very confusing system.)_

#### Cognitive capitalism

* technological determinism is not enough to explain changes (how technology is
  deployed is always up to people, never neutral)
* we are entering a stage of **cognitive capitalism**: knowledge production is
  a key source of value in the modern economy, and we cannot separate that from
  society
* one consequence of this is the increasing importance of intangible goods:
  brands, intellectual property, data, etc
  * huge change from industrial age when most value was contained in material
    goods
* control of innovation means control of the profits
  * companies are starting to realise that you can't (as you used to be able to
    do) just "buy" technology and expect it to magically improve your
    productivity
  * instead, you have to foster the right workplace culture, which might mean
    loosening hierarchies or giving employees more freedom to try new things
* companies want to be more flexible and responsive to trends (think fast
  fashion and their terrifying rapid production cycles)
* in the past, corporations could manage complexity simply by growing the
  company, but now you have to actually adapt (or risk becoming a dinosaur)
* changing modes of production: users now co-produce (think YouTube videos and
  tweets and other user-generated content, but also the rise of influencer
  marketing and how that's starting to transform the advertising industry)
* blurring of inputs to production (capital/labour), since now we have lots of
  labour mediated by tech
* emergence of networks for organisation/cooperation ... neither hierarchical
  (like a state) nor anarchic (like the market). biggest example: Wikipedia (a
  very common example for people writing on this stuff in the mid 2000s, when
  Wikipedia seemed like a model for the future of everything)
* a shift to cognitive/emotional labour (services over manufacturing). the
  example given was that of Pret employees being told to cultivate a certain
  atmosphere in order to please the customer (the company wants control over
  its employees' affects)
* the most important resource is "invention power": the capacity to create and
  invent
* innovation is now a social process, no longer the result of a lone wolf (if
  it ever was)---it can be distributed geographically, even between disparate
  companies (think Silicon Valley as a regional concentration of power)
* crisis of property rights (tension between intellectual property and the open
  source movement)
* the capturing of positive externalities (in which a third party---i.e., a
  corporation---gets the benefit of the transaction between two parties)
  * corporations monetise this
  * example of positive externality: we go to university but all of society
    benefits, at least theoretically, and so this is why we should all get free
    tuition (Srnicek's idea, though ofc I wholeheartedly agree)
* centrality of bioproduction: if cognitive capitalism is centred on the
  production of knowledge, then it must also be concerned with the bio
  conditions for it
* we've moved from mercantilism to industrial capitalism to today's cognitive
  capitalism
  * though the question is: how geographically limited is this theory? how much
    has cognitive capitalism spread into the non-OECD countries, for instance?
  * case in point: China---maybe in the tertiary industries, sure, but there's
    still a lot of industrial capitalism going on
* to summarise cognitive capitalism:
  * what is being accumulated: knowledge and the capacity for creativity, not
    physical property
  * how is production organised: intelligent coordination of minds, not a rigid
    division of labour
  * who is being exploited: positive externalities created by the
    "cognitariat", as opposed to the proletariat
* consequences:
  * blurring of work and non-work: with factory shifts, e.g., scooping cereal
    into cereal boxes, the line was stark; but with cognitive work, there is
    potentially no end to the shift
  * the end of scarcity (at least potentially): non-rival, theoretically
    infinitely replicable; any scarcity is artificially imposed
* even if everything becomes abundant, though, we're still limited in
  attention--the last scarcity

#### The attention economy

* in the early 1800s, newspapers started selling ads ... since then, it's been
  a race to the bottom
* you can see fake news as less of a contemporary phenomenon and more of an
  almost immanent consequence of the attention economy (there's a photo of a
  news article from 1835 about obviously fake moon people)
* at some point the amount of information available exceeds the amount of
  attention we could potentially pay to it
  * though my response to this is: doesn't that depend on what we valorise as
    "information"? in a way, there was _always_ more information than we could
    pay attention to. we could sit and watch grass grow or listen to birdcalls
    all day, if we wanted---that's still information, in a way. we just don't
    valorise that sort of thing as "information"
* important to remember that the attention economy is not applicable to just
  ads-based tech companies: it really includes **anything on a screen**
  * quote from Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix: they're competing with not just
    YouTube and SnapChat but also, well, sleep
  * and of course these companies try to design for addiction (think Netflix's
    autoplay, or endless scroll)
  * question: can we rely on "self-control" when these corporations are
    employing entire teams of very intelligent people whose job it is to break
    any self-control we might exhibit? do we really control what we use or
    watch or has it started controlling us?
