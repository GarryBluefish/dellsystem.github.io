I wasn't in the mood to write anything new today, so here's a compendium of some of the best tweets on my timeline about the [elite college admissions scandal](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/college-bribe-scandal-shows-elite-college-obsession/584719/). (Click the image to be taken to the tweet itself, if it's still up. Apologies for the BuzzFeed-esque post today. I need to spend less time on Twitter.)

Things are still terrible overall, and it's too early to tell if this will actually change anything (for the better), but it was still nice to see the facade crumble in such an explosive way. Meritocracy was always a BS concept but at least now the mask is off.
