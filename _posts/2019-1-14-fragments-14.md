title: So you want to do a masters degree on inequality

Today's blog post is a short one because, once again, I left it until the last minute. (I'll get better at this, I promise.)

Some of you know that I recently completed a masters degree on inequality at the London School of Economics. It was a one-year program, and I left the program considerably less starry-eyed about academia than when I [first applied](/posts/a-personal-statement). I've posted all my notes & essays [here](/lse), but lots of people have reached out asking for more details on the program (and whether I recommend it), so I figured I'd write a little more about my personal impressions.

First of all, if you're _really_ interested in the topic of inequality, here are some articles I highly recommend on the topic, complete with meta-analysis of the very framing (as the agency-less "inequality" rather than, say, "exploitation" or "class war"):

* [The Inequality Industry](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-inequality-industry/) by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian for _The Nation_. A nice overview of the rise of foundations/programs looking at "inequality", including the program I was in at LSE.
* [How to change the course of human history](https://www.eurozine.com/change-course-human-history/) by David Graeber and David Wengrow for _Eurozine_, which approaches it from an anthropological perspective. It's a long read, but well worth it for its thoughtful, nuanced critique the depoliticisation so typically associated with "inequality" studies: "‘Inequality’ is a way of framing social problems appropriate to technocratic reformers, the kind of people who assume from the outset that any real vision of social transformation has long since been taken off the political table."
* [Who cares about inequality?](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/01/who-cares-about-inequality) by David Adler for _Current Affairs_. Why the super-rich suddenly care about inequality.
* [Survival of the Richest](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1) by Douglas Rushkoff. A fun read about rich people being worried about the coming apocalypse.
* [The Gospel of Wealth](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/tim-rogan-moral-economists-critique-capitalism-book-review) by Tehila Sasson for _Dissent_.

Some thoughts on the program itself:

* There are some decent modules, but the overall angle felt quite liberal.
* It costs _a lot of money_. (Somewhere around £10k for home/EU students; as an international student, I paid just over £20k.)
* There are probably some jobs that would look favourably on you having the degree. So it might be worth it for that. But maybe look into that first, before you shell out £10/20k.
* Some of the best people (imo) involved with the inequalities institute have recently left the institute. Take that as you will.

For me personally, most of my political education - my leftward drift over the past 2 years - was acquired _outside_ the program. I gained way more out of reading books, going to random events in London, following good people on Twitter, and editing for New Socialist & Notes From Below.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend the inequalities program. If you feel like you need a masters degree from LSE, try the political sociology masters. Or, if you want a tech focus, try the data & society masters in the Media & Comms department.

But that's only if you really feel like you need a degree from a prestigious-sounding institution. If you care more about the actual learning process, or meeting cool people, consider other universities, even if they're lower down in the rankings.

Final tip: don't study inequality. Study capitalism.
