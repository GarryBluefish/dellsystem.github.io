### Readings

#### [Learning to Immaterial Labour (PDF)](http://www.ephemerajournal.org/sites/default/files/7-1cote-pybus.pdf) by Mark Cot√© and Jennifer Pybus

On the source of MySpace's ridiculously high
valuation at the time of its acquisition by News Corporation ($580 million).

#### [Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy (PDF)](http://web.mit.edu/schock/www/docs/18.2terranova.pdf) by Tiziana Terranova

On knowledge work in the new digital economy and how it relates to classical
Marxist ideas. I need to re-read this more carefully but it seems really,
really good.

#### [Digital Labour and Karl Marx](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17939361-digital-labour-and-karl-marx) by Christian Fuchs

It's a 400-page book (in the Recommended Reading section) so I haven't had a
chance to get to it yet, but it looks pretty awesome and I'm stoked to read it.

### Lecture

* an overview of tech companies that sold for ridiculous amounts in recent years
  * MySpace, $580m to News Corp in 2005, never having made a profit; resold for
    $35m in 2011
  * Instagram, $1b to Facebook in 2012, with $2.7m in losses and 13 employees
  * WhatsApp, $19b to Facebook in 2014, with $138m in losses and 32 employees
  * LinkedIn, $26b to Microsoft in 2016, having lost $166m in 2015
* moving beyond the obvious point that valuations are arbitrary and not
  necessarily reflective of any sort of "value" that can be agreed on
  objectivity, we can still find a common factor that explains the seemingly
  excessive valuations among these companies, and that is user data
* if you look at companies like Google, Twitter, FB: 90%+ of revenue comes from
  advertising, which means that their audiences are the commodities being sold
* we see a shift from the old TV-based advertising model---where audiences are
  treated as passive consumers---to a more interactive model where audiences
  are actively producing content as well (think YouTube, Instagram, Twitter)
* today: focus on platforms with lots of user-generated content (Snapchat,
Twitter, Facebook, etc). excluding Apple because most of their revenue
comes from selling physical phones (although, to be fair, the value of the
phones is partly due to the UGC provided by the app development community)
* we can think of this user-generated content as **immaterial labour** (knowledge, culture, ideas,
  etc)
  * the work we do is individualised and portrayed to us as
    "self-investment": we're building up our entrepreneurial profile, our
    "brand", our cultural capital
  * also usually affective: social, emotional (making connections, reading
    the "room", empathy in anticipating reactions, etc)
* and of course this labour produces value for these corporations:
  * when we like pages on FB, we're telling FB what our preferences are and
    thus enabling them to target ads better
  * when we Google something and click through to a link, we're giving Google
    feedback that it can use to make it search algorithms better
  * thus our entire online activity is a source of profit for these
    corporations---we are a source of free labour
* so the question is: what can we as consumers, workers, citizens etc do??
  * [Wages for Facebook](http://wagesforfacebook.com) is one campaign
    (modelled after Wages for Housework in the 60s, which was intended to raise
    the visibility of unpaid domestic work done primarily by women)
  * show of hands in the class: no one thinks we deserve wages for Facebook
    * in fact one student suggests that if we _were_ paid to use FB, the
      system could fall victim to manipulation
    * another student says that we're provided a service (i.e., the ability t
      use Facebook) in exchange so it's fair
    * another says that we don't deserve _regular_ wages, but if Facebook is
      selling data to third parties, then maybe we should be renumerated for
      that
    * (in any case, the whole point of the Wages for Facebook campaign is less
      to actually demand wages from FB and more to get people to realise that
      FB is exploiting us)
  * Jaron Lanier's proposal, in [Who Owns The Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15802693-who-owns-the-future)
    * incidentally, I read this book by happenstance a few days prior, and
      wrote [a fairly negative review on
      Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2054329970) which you
      can read if you're curious
    * his main idea is that tech companies should compensate people for the
      value they provide via their personal data
    * result: micropayments, creation of personal data markets
    * basically extending this neoliberal hellscape we live in just a tiny bit
      farther
    * (you can tell I'm not on board with this idea)
    * Srnicek brings up: does this mean that only rich people will be able to
      afford privacy, while poor people will have to live in a privacy-less
      dystopia?
    * how much is personal data worth, anyway? usually each transaction results
      in only fractions of a cent for each user---will that result in enough
      value over time to make these micropayments worth implementing?
* Srnicek mentions UBI as a potential response to problems caused by
  automation, and also in recognition of the fact that a lot of work is
  currently not being paid
  * my own take on UBI is similar to my take on Jaron Lanier's micropayment
    scheme: I see it as a suboptimal solution whose primary function is to
    preserve this dying capitalist shell a little while longer etc etc, your
    mileage may vary
* Srnicek's skepticism of the Wages for Facebook campaign
  * are these companies exploiting unpaid work? it certainly doesn't feel like
    work, but of course, just because we don't think of it as work doesn't
    necessarily mean that it's not work
  * if we're actually providing free labour for which we're not compensated,
    you'd think that there would be economic growth as a result; instead, we're
    living at a time of secular stagnation
    * my response to that would be the tendency of tech companies to try and
      shrink markets (which Jaron Lanier does address quite well in his book)
      but I'd have to think about this some more
  * we should go back to first principles and decide on what "work" even is
  * in capitalism, wage-labour is just a particular way of organising work
    * in it, workers don't own the means of production, and usually have
      little input in decisions & no claim to the goods produced
    * therefore, for online work to be exploitative, it needs a certain set of
      social relations around it
    * if it is exploitative, it's certainly not the kind of exploitation we're
      used to with wage-labour: there's no boss telling us to get work done
      * my thoughts: doesn't that just mean it's self-employment, where the
        superego is the boss? whether or not it's ontologically a form of
        wage-labour doesn't really matter imo
    * as content creators, we do decide what to produce (within limits), and we
      have (some) intellectual property rights
    * thus Srnicek concludes that digital content creators aren't just another
      form of wage labour (which I agree with to an extent---it kind of
      depends on your purpose for classifying something as "wage labour")
* Srnicek concludes that we should be skeptical of the idea that online labour
  is exploitative, and that we are producing commodities & thus free labour for
  these companies (at least when it comes to a very specific, academic
  definition of "labour")
* question to ponder: should content creators on, say, YouTube, be guaranteed
  specific workers' rights?
  * my response is no but that comes from a fairly radical place of wanting to
    transcend the idea of "work" entirely
  * i also kinda hate the whole influencer culture that YouTube/IG/Snapchat et
    al have spawned, which is an extremely unequal industry almost entirely
    funded by selling unnecessary crap to audiences (not that different from
    the entertainment industry as a whole but it's just a little more blatant
    about it)
  * sometimes I'm afraid that I focus too much on sweeping, fundamental changes
    that need to be made at the expense of being able to propose small steps in
    the right direction
    * this is one of those cases
    * is it even possible to make tech companies sufficiently "better" without
      fundamentally transforming the whole economic system? I DONT KNOW AND IT
      SCARES ME
    * pls tell me if you have any thoughts on this ty
