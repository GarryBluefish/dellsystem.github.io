_(I didn't attend this lecture because I didn't consider the possibility of
auditing this course until the following week. What follows is a summary of the
readings listed in the course handbook.)_

## Readings

### [The Second Economy](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-second-economy) from McKinsey Quarterly, 2011

A fairly light and business-friendly read about the digital economy. The most
salient takeaway I got is that technology is not just an industry, but an
intelligent system (akin to a nervous system) underneath the entire economy.
The challenge, now, is not greater production, but rather better distribution
of the prosperity that it can bring us.

### [Platform Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32999998-platform-capitalism) by Nick Srnicek

This was in the "Recommended Reading" section which could be seen as a bit of a
cheeky way of boosting sales of his book (it's relevant to the course,
obviously). I read this over the summer and thought it was excellent. You can
find some of my notes, attached to specific passages from the book, on
[Bookmarker](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/book/platform-capitalism/notes).
