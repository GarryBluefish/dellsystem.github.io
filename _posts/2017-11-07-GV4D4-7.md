### Readings

#### Religion and the Western Welfare State by Philip Manow and Kees van Kersbergen

An essay from [Religion, Class Coalitions, and Welfare States (PDF)](http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/97914/frontmatter/9780521897914_frontmatter.pdf), published in 2010. Challenging the traditional explanations for Christian Democratic welfare states.

* incidentally, as generous as the Scandinavian welfare states are in terms of spending, the level of decommodification isn't actually that high---there's less countering of the market
* Catholic social doctrine -> patriarchical, status-based hierarchy
* we can't just focus on the labour-capital class struggle, but need to consider state-church conflict as well
  * especially in 19th century (due to educational, social policy differences)
  * thus parties of "religious defence" sprung up in continental Europe but not Scandi, UK -> influenced dev of welfare states
  * anticlerical element obvious in Italy, Belgium, France in contrast to the Catholicism of other countries
* we also can't ignore the influence of Protestantism
  * the reformed version _delayed_ the development of the welfare state
  * whereas Lutheran state churches (Germany, Scandi) _supported_ it
* not industrialism but instead establishment of labour markets that gave rise to welfare states
  * "a market economy could only function in a market society" thus society had to be transformed to make markets the guiding principle
  * ofc, full commodification of laboour is impossible as it's a **fictitious commodity** & would be destroyed in the process
  * this is the logic behind Polanyi's **double movement**: a partial commodification of labour necessitates its partial decommodification
  * otoh, this theory desn't explain differences _among_ countries (with different welfare state patterns)
  * instead, for a fuller picture, we should look at the coalitions that the political left could make
* Soskice & Iverson's 2006 model
  * from the POV of the middle class (with the fairly ridiculous assumption of equally-sized lower, middle, upper classes)
  * with a left-wing govt, the middle class believes it'll pay taxes primarily for the benefit of the lower classes
  * whereas, with a right-wing govt, it recognises there will be fewer benefits, but believes it'll pay fewer taxes
  * thus the middle class will tend to vote right-wing more often
  * but in a multi-party system, if the left-wing party forms a coalition with one that also represents the middle class, then there'll be a party that taxes the rich and shares the benefits among the bottom two classes
    * I gotta say, I am puzzled as to why the original left-wing party wouldn't just go for that in the first place
  * basically they're saying that PR (or lack thereof) helps explain why non-economic party cleavages form
  * religious social mobilisation more likely when there's a less extensive welfare state

#### [Once Again a Model (PDF)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonas_Pontusson/publication/265199781_Once_Again_A_Model_Nordic_Social_Democracy_in_a_Globalized_World_Forthcoming_in/links/549427270cf28a646fb55c87/Once-Again-A-Model-Nordic-Social-Democracy-in-a-Globalized-World-Forthcoming-in.pdf) by Jonas Pontusson

From 2009 (appearing in the 2011 book "Futures of the Left"). On how Nordic social democracy continues to function in an era of globalisation.

* compared to continental model, scandi states focus on social citizenship, not due to working contributions
  * don't spend that much GDP on income transfers but it's more effective at reducing income ineq than in other countries
  * denmark has least restrictive laws for firing workers
* Rehn-Meidner model: goal of labour movement is to improve productivity growth & contain wage inflation
  * main insight: low wages are subsidy for inefficient capital
  * also that wage differentials necessary to encourage skilling up
* norway challenges esping-anderson's idea of decommodification
  * public investment in education etc doesnt actually reduce decommod & emancipate them from labour markets
  * rather, it empowers their ability to sell labour power
  * thus achieves economic efficiency in a way consistent with the neoclassical model
* financial features of CMEs
  * firms have limited exposure to financial markets, instead long-term stakeholders & long-term finance
  * cross-share holdings among firms, protecting against vagaries of cap markets and thread of hostile takeovers + better coord
  * long-term emplyment, trust in workplaces, high-quality industrial goods
* rather than generating convergence toward liberal model, globalisation instead keeps open gulf between LME, CME (different comparative advantages)
* wage compression is actually good for firms w/ above-avg profits
* unionisation rates obvs way higher, 79 in sweden and 54 in norway though falling everywhere except finland 76
* virtuous cycle: socdem model requires but also sustains strong unions
* nordic countries relied on prod growth to achieve econ growth (employment growth sluggish)
  * unemployment much higher in finland tho falling lately (growth higher too)
  * germany less services than the others (68 vs 79 in US, 74 nordic avg)
  * public sector share of total employment hasnt grown in nordic since 90s
  * in sweden: deregulation of cap markets similar to thatcher's big bang
    * contributed to asset bubble and crisis of 1991-2 but also helped swedish firms get access to capital
  * denmark: "flexicurity" in 90s, budgetary prssures for welfare state spending cuts to reform unemployment
    * but due to necessity not liberal ideology
    * the reason they could engage in dereg has to do with existence of welfare state in first place
  * high pub investment in education contributed to growth of knowledge-intensive sectors

### Lecture

* last time, we focused on the structural causes of inequality in LMEs
* but inequality is rising even in non-liberal market economies (we can call them social or coordinated market economies, fairly interchangeably)
* recall the distinction between LMEs/CMEs
  * even in LMEs, there is some type of market suppression (e.g., markets for illegal substances, like certain drugs)
  * in LMEs, though, suppression is leaner, and usually more for efficiency rather than equity reasons
  * goal for today: look at how political institutions in CMEs contain, tame and suppress markets
  * focus on continental/Northern/Southern Europe (parts of East Asia would also qualify but we won't be focusing on them)
* even among CMEs there are dividing lines along religious or legal origin grounds
  * on the religious front:
    * Protestant reformation of 1517; Scandinavia mostly Protestant; Southern Europe and France mostly Catholic or Orthodox
    * continental: mix of multiple religions without hegemony of any one (Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland)
    * recall Max Weber's Protestant ethic theory
    * ofc the open question comes down to endogeneity: did religion influence the type of capitalism or vice versa?
  * on legal origin: LMEs all use English common law
    * French legal framework used in continental, Southern Europe
    * German/Scandinavian legal system used in continental/Northern Europe (Germany tends to be very rule-based, legally and economically)
* Esping-Anderson uses several somewhat interchangeable terms to refer to this religious-geographical-political admixture:
  * corporatist / conservative / Christian-Democract / continental
  * also Bismarckian (in the sense of the welfare system), as opposed to the British variant inspired by Beveridge
* on the historical development of welfare states
  * conditioned by authoritarianism (Bismarck used welfare state to palliate the working class and thus prevent an uprising)
  * countries with strong Communist (Marxist) movements, like Germany and France, tend to have more history of authoritarian rule (perhaps as a response) and thus welfare states (though not the Scandinavian kind)
  * the takeaway is that welfare states should be seen as a pragmatic, shrewd, and conservative development to curtail the working class, _not_ an inherently liberatory one
* the role of Catholicism in welfare state development in continental Europe
  * doctrinal basis: "Christian social theory"
  * personalism: personal fulfillment through community (in stable, unchanging, hierarchical relations)
  * social responsibilty as opposed to individual (liberalism) or collective (socialism)
  * the big goal is community solidarity via class integration (as opposed to class consciousness)
  * secular movements, especially trade-union-related, are viewed with suspicion
  * thus this is neither a liberal idea (the individual is seen as part of a larger whole) nor a Marxist one (no class divisions)
  * represents a third way between capitalism and socialism (suspicious of both)
    * attentive to the misery created by markets
    * but also saw private property as a bedrock of society (after all, the Church itself tended to have a lot)
    * qualified support of trade unions + role of state in protecting the poor
  * in 1931, Pope Pius Xi anounced the need to restore harmony in society
    * his vision was based on the primary of functional/vocational groups ("corporations" though not in the common sense of the term---instead, just groups of people with cohesive vocational interests)
    * unlike traditional liberal thought, asserts that society should take precedence over the economy
  * thus the coalition of Christian and conservative forces resulted in some level fo decommodification, manifesting as ordoliberalism ([Erhard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Erhard) concept of a social market economy)
    * involves some level of market suppression, as well as some level of compensation for those who are failed by the market
    * consistent with social hierarchies (class, family, church, etc)
    * the goal is neither individual freedom nor real egalitarianism
    * enforced via a legalist approach (i.e., the state, not corporations)
  * result: an extensive welfare state with benefits applied _selectively_ (depending on your vocational affilitation, usually through the form of social insurance contributions etc)
    * includes the middle classes
    * less about providing services and more about cash transfers
    * financed by workers (and primarily provided to workers)
* the Southern European flavour is a bit different: more family dependency, larger informal sector, some welfare benefits but low replacement rates
* Northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and somewhat the Netherlands and Austria)
  * more socialist than continental Europe (socdem parties have more influence than Christian Democratic ones)
  * though Germany has also had some socdem party rule as well as CD, sometimes in coalition
  * Italy, on the other hand, had quite a large CD influence between 1948-1994, but that party no longer exists
* Recall Esping-Anderson on how socialist parties need to build coalitions with other parties in order to get into power
  * because there are never enough people just in the industrial working class to form a majority
  * the combination of socialist and agrarian parties (aka a red-green coaliation) common for Scandinavia
* Now on the Marxist/Labourist doctrinal basis of socdem parties, most notably in Scandinavia
  * incidentally, 1994 was a turning point for the UK Labour Party (Tony Blair won leadership); this led to party dropping references to socialism (but it's back now baby <3)
  * socdem as an alternative to violent revolution (Eduard Bernstein wrote a lot on this in his 1899 book ["Evolutionary Socialism"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/works/1899/evsoc/index.htm))
  * mixture of egalitarian and liberal ideals, where you have to accept some bourgeois elements like private property + markets
  * the goal is to enhance the power of workers, in order to force capital to make some concessions (this is in line with [power resource theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_resource_theory))
    * alternatively, we can view the concessions on the part of capital (welfare state, etc) as premeditated on the part of capital---they recognised that it would be better for them in the long term (in this theory, there is no conflict)
  * in this model, the decommodification brought about by the welfare state is about compensating for market failures, more than it is about suppressing the market
  * it also challenges traditional hierarchies (esp gender)
  * based on the idea of **market openness**: high levels of international trade (in some Scandinavian countries, the sum of imports and exports is greater than GDP), but the population is _sheltered_ from any pernicious effects via the welfare state
  * high taxes not only on income but also (primarily?) consumption (VAT)
* looking at the particular case of Sweden (not just the ability of the welfare state to compensate for inequality, but also the inequality caused by the market)
  * high taxes
  * socdem hegemony since the 30's
  * 90% union coverage so high levels of centralised wage bargaining
  * followed the [Rehn-Meidner model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehn%E2%80%93Meidner_model) from 50s-70s: a Keynesian economic model that desired low inflation, high employment, high growth, and income equality
    * lots of wage compression (low-skilled workers are paid more than they would be under a freer market, high-skilled workers less)
      * this had the effect of driving uncompetitive firms out of the market
      * note that this aspect of the economy isn't actually part of the welfare state, since it's not govt policy, but it forms an important pillar
    * an [**active labour market policy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_labour_market_policies) where the govt helps people retrain and pays them unemployment benefits in the meantime
      * the benefit of the latter is greater market efficiency---workers won't fight to keep their unprofitable corporations running because they'll be taken care of in the meantime & will be retrained for a more productive role
    * low taxes on capital, contingent on reinvestment
    * high taxes (esp sales tax) to finance welfare states & suppress inflation
    * basically this model only works if productivity is high

### Seminar

#### Who are welfare states for?

We started by discussing this news story: [Elderly husband's plea as Scot's wife of 30 years set to be kicked out of country due to Tory immigration crackdown](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/husbands-plea-scots-wife-30-11474002). The big question revolved around whether he should be entitled to welfare or not.

* pros:
  * he is a citizen, and his family probably paid into the welfare state
  * he's also old and vulnerable, can't really penalise him cus he's probably too old to get a job, so unless we like the idea of just sentencing him to death ...
* cons: if he hasn't paid anything in why should he get something out, plus this results in moral hazard for freeriders
* alternative proposal: South Africa should be part of the discussion since he paid in to the South African welfare state for so long
* my take: extreme frustration with the way the question was posed in the first place
  * it's exactly like all the focus on benefits fraud etc by the very poor
  * the whole point of this rhetoric is to undermine solidarity among the poor
  * getting people to squabble over tiny amounts and creating an us-vs-them mentality precisely to divide and distract them from the fact that the people on top are making sooo much more
  * it makes no sense to focus on this one guy when the amount of money involved is so small compared to how much is lost via tax avoidance
    * or, to take a slightly more radical note, by allowing inheritance at all
* and yet: it's easy to feel indignant about this case, given that he opted to take on more private risk & gain reward from the UK welfare state when that didn't work out
  * feels opportunistic
  * esp if you see it from an individualistic, classic liberal sense (and in many ways, we've all been inculcated with liberal ideology)
  * on the other hand, we all benefit from being able to take advantage of the system; it's a floor for all of us
* the reverse question is: should a South African citizen paying in to the UK welfare state benefit?
  * the larger question is: _whom_ should a national welfare state benefit in the first place?
    * we need to take into account incentive-setting and moral hazard when shaping these welfare systems
  * Hopkin brought up a camping analogy (imagine if someone sat around and didn't help but still expected to eat food and sleep in a tent etc)
    * a student brought up, as a rebuttal, Gerald Cohen's critique of Rawls' which basically tears apart this camping analogy lol
    * in an ideal situation, you wouldn't have any nitpicking, and would instead allow people to do what they're best at
    * which might mean that some do less than others but that's okay as long as you have solidarity and a sense of community
    * from his very short book [Why Not Socialism?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6764834-why-not-socialism)

#### On the development of welfare states

* biggest different in welfare states today: nationality/citizenship vs contribution/insurance
* modernisation as the standard polanyi explanation
  *  functionalist theory
  * implies that protective institutions dev almost automatically as market does, without thinking about mechanism (inevitable result of dismantling feudal system)
  * if we stick to modernisation framework: when industrialisation happened, or what specific industries (Italy/France still agrarian for a while). or maybe specifics of feudal system? or geography, hence mercantilism patterns
* ofc we prefer the power resources approach instead: class coalitions, social mobilisation

#### Iversion and Soskice

* on the iverson soskice middle class theory which is (imo) way too simplified, doesn't take into account the size of middle class
  * their model assumes lower/middle/upper classes are equal size, so not very realistic, lots of handwaving
  * also assumes rational selfish actors who optimise for themselves individually
  * and that left-wing parties need to focus on the lower classes only ...
* suggests that FPTP systems tend to create a single dimension of polarity, usually around economics
  * ofc there's the question of of endogeneity: is a PR system the result of not being able to resolve all issues within 2-party system?
  * one theory on why US never had proper working class movement comes down to ethnic divisions as a result of slavery
  * and in countries with more religious divisions, anticlerical/not or catholic/protestant -> drives a wedge

#### On religious explanations

* catholic-inspired welfare states:
  * status-driven
  * about keeping things together (solidarity) not really egalitarianism
* reformed vs lutheran protestant distinction important for US/Scandi distinction (Lutheran more pro-govt, Calvinist more hostile to state)
* what about having church embedded in state, like norway or UK? doesn't really predict much
* recall nordic, agrarian parties pushed for citizenship benefits as opposed to contribution-based benefits which is what workers might have preferred (selfishly)
  * question about nordic countries' advantage (partly due to higher productivity)
    * my thought: does this core require a periphery/hinterlands (a la Streeck on Germany?)
  * are institutions enough to make say southern europe develop or are there geographical factors too
