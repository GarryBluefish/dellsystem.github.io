In the last few months - since I finished my masters degree - a fair number of people have asked me for advice about (critical) masters degrees and/or whether they should get a job in tech. People who are still in school ask about job options post-masters degree, and whether working for a big tech company would be "selling out". People who are considering a masters degree like mine ask whether it's worth it, or if they should just work in the tech industry.

Until recently, I didn't have an answer. But I think I now have an answer that sort of makes sense. If you have the option to work in tech, and the only thing stopping you from taking that option is a vague sense of guilt (and you don't have anything else you especially want to be doing), just take it. Take the job.

But organise.

Don't feel guilty about it. After all, you are an individual worker in a larger econmic landscape shaped by forces way outside your control. If you dont have like family money, and havent been lucky in the startup lottery, then you're going to need a job. If you're interested in tech criticism, your options outside the industry are limited. You could stay in academia, and compete for a dwindlng number of full-time jobs with slowly-eroding benefits; you could try to work for a left-wing think tank, or union, or political party (also very competitive); you could try to get a full-time job as a staff writer (not many of those available) or write freelance (not easy financially, let me tell you).

If you have the option to work in the tech industry, and the only thing stopping you is a vague sense of ethical discomfort (at what tech is doing to the world) or fear of "selling out", then here's my advice: take the job, and organise with your coworkers as part of the growing labour movement in tech. The tech industry is pretty awful at the moment, marred by scandal after scandal. But it doesn't have to be that way, and one of the most hopeful avenues for changing it is through [building worker power](https://novaramedia.com/2018/06/27/now-is-the-time-for-worker-power-in-the-tech-industry/).

None of this is to say that I think you _have_ to work in tech if you have the chance, or that you have some sort of responsibility to your fellow workers to do so. Your responsibility is to yourself first and foremost, not some amorphous idea of your class (put your own mask before helping others!). Prioritise your own well-being, because no one else will do it for you, and even if your end goal is to help others, you'll have to help yourself first.

The point I'm trying to make here is that there is _another option_ besides enduring an awful tech job that you don't really want to do. It's not a dichotomy between working in tech (and being complicit), versus quitting tech (and being broke). There is a third option: stay and fight. Work in the industry and make use of your passions and skillset to the best of your abilities, while also recognising that the industry is structurally flawed and needs to be radically changed if it is ever going to _really_ make the world a better place. And you can be part of this radical change if you start organising.

Now, more than ever, is a great time to stay in tech, with tech worker organising starting to really ramp up (see: [Tech Workers Coalition](https://techworkerscoalition.org/)!). Find a campaign at your workplace, or start your own, or just talk to colleagues about what you want to see change at your company. Engage with the copious amounts of tech industry criticism out there and try to boil it down to small, incremental, concrete demands. There are already so many people writing excellent and important criticism - it's just not getting read by the people who actually have a chance at changing things. Criticism is great and all, but it also needs a path to being heard, and that's where people in the industry come in.
