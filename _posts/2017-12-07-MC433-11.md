### Readings

#### [Inclusion and Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/483477.Inclusion_and_Democracy) by Iris Marion Young (chapter 2)

* external exclusion from democratic deliberation (when outside interests dominate political discourse, due to inequalities of power/resources)
* internal inclusion: when certain groups (putatively part of the deliberation process) are just not respected as much
* mentions Charles Taylor's politics of recognition
* didn't really take away that much tbh

### Lecture

* an excellent overview of the challenges posed by the economic dominance of the contemporary tech giants
  * big 5 of tech (Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook)
  * their dominance isnt just evident in the services they provide, but in the way they control capital flows
  * remember that when [Microsoft acquired Linkedin for $26b](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/microsoft-officially-closes-its-26-2b-acquisition-of-linkedin/), it did so primarily via [a debt instrument](https://www.ft.com/content/84e54052-5818-11e6-8d05-4eaa66292c32) to avoid a 35% repatriation tax
  * any attempts to regulate them in terms of privacy or data protection are inadequate because they miss the more fundamental, structural aspects of their dominance (affirmative, not transformative)
  * _pace_ those in tech who stress that it's not about the money, we must take a materialist approach to understand motives/paths
* on digital exclusion
  * could it be a resource, a way of buying time to deliberate on how to reconstruct infrastructure?
* open Q: are algorithmic platforms like Google/Facebook inevitable?
  * or are they just the result of technology being deployed in a world reliant on ad-fueled cosumption
  * note to self: think about the Marxian idea of advertising as being part of the cost of circulation in the market (and not itself a source of value), and how that would fit in with modern-day ad-tech
