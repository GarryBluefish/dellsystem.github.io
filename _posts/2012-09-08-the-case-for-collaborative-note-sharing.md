* arguing that it's copyrighted
	* grey area. _should_ it be copyrighted? if a judge rules that students learning something in class then later sharing that information is copyright infringement, then that doesn't mean that it's wrong. in fact, it would be a fairly irresponsible ruling.
	* some professors are uncomfortable with the idea that students will share the contents of their lectures with others. why? isn't the point of teaching to share knowledge with your students? i know some professors who really do want their students to learn the material better, and thus have no problem with something like wikinotes. there are also some professors who do not feel this way. okay. for the most part, we respect a professor's wishes.
* class attendance
	* if going to class is worthless, something wikinotes can replace it, then that's not the fault of the better product.
	* artificial means to boost a professor's ego. if going to class is worthless, and students react by no longer attending class, that's valid etc
	* a good professor will attract students no matter what. should be taken as an indication that maybe your teaching style is lacking. (or maybe the students just don't care.)
* lots of people who don't want to share their notes.
	* arguments like: i worked hard, other people work less hard, why should they reap the benefits, i'm competing with them to get into med school or a job, etc.
	* lot of counter-arguments: help others, is it that difficult? you all get better, altruism isn't the worst thing ever.
	* but it's usually useless. it's like trying to convince someone that their religion is flawed, or trying to convince a windows user to switch over to linux. the validity of your arguments rarely matters if someone is really entrenched in their viewpoint.
	* but you know what? that's fine. a lot of people just don't want to share their notes, for whatever reason. we don't have a problem with that. we do want to persuade more people to share their notes, of course, but if someone adamantly refuses to do so then that's the end of it. as long as there are enough people who share our beliefs - in freely accessible information, helping your peers, etc - to sustain wikinotes.
	* Obviously, our leecher to seeder ratio is enormous, but whatever. we can handle it.
