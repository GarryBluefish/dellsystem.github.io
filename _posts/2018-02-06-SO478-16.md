Aaron Reeves talking about health inequalities. My notes aren't great, sorry. No notes from the readings.

### Lecture

* talking about cholera
* mortality rates across europe
* what explains health disparities between countries
* relative position in income distribution affects mortality, not just the actual amount you earn
	* (obvs, cus it controls what goods you have access to)
* incentives for ruling classes to contain public health lower cus they're not really as integrated, more segregated
	* otoh labour costs will rise if a bunch of people die lol
* why is health so much worse in the US
	* food deserts where it's really hard to get healthy food
	* healthcare
	* lifestyle choices (smoking, diet) but ofc look at structural factors too
* my thought: why are we so focused on mortality
	* when it's a spectrum, having to work long hours at a shitty minimum wage job and living in a shitty house and having to sit on public transit for two hours every day is pretty close to death but that's normalised
* rel between income ineq and health depends on the level of income ineq (like second order) yeah no shit
* one of those lectures meant to convince ppl that things are bad, well im convinced
	* preaching to the choir etc
	* increasingly realising that this program isnt really a good fit for me (or im not a good fit for the program)
* on comparing health for diff income ineq levels when controlled for total income level
	* my thought: it's all relative cus it depends on labour power and shit and what money actually buys you
	* plus health doesnt measure everything, mortality isnt the only important thing
	* mental health??? alienation
* wilkinson focused on when countries are already at a high level of wealth, just looking at ineq levels AMONG those countries, focused on that very small subset

### Seminar

* criticism of the spirit level (delusion, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/26/response-spirit-level-bad-social-science)
	* from what i've heard, the spirit level's strategy was to put together a bunch of case studies to prove that inequality is also bad for rich people? a very particular case of the shifted baseline phenomenon
	* i would critique it from the left but at least it moves overton window idk
* that 1980 report on healthcare shocked ppl cus national healthcare service etc
	* my thought: what do people think income inequality is FOR if it doesnt negatively impact health
	* like what is the purpose, what is being distributed?
	* why dont i care about health in general
	* because it's not directly correlated to exploitation (ie systematised oppression) like smoking pollution diet etc
	* the parts i care about are those tht are a direct result of capitalism/etc
* boiling down wilkinson pickett arg to its core, inequality per se is bad for you
	* agreed cus labour-power
	* but also cost of living
	* and hiring people to shine shoes
* higher level problem: income inequality being important symptom of commodified, rampant capitalism and other systems of structural oppression
	* why are people locked up? property crimes, or drug crimes
