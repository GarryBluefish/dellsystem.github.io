### Lecture

(no time for seminar)

* knowledge economy, transition from a time (golden ages, fordist) when stats were all good and moving in the right direction
	* and then NEOLIBERALISM came *shock*
	* things get better during the 1990s
	* quote: chair of federal reserve bank, "age of great moderation"
	* which ofc came to an end (or maybe pause) with fin crisis
	* focused on advanced world (US, western europe and japan) since it's driven both the ups and the downs
	* switch in regime from mass prod to ICT
	* acknowledged the role of politics, all key decisions are ultimately political
* from fordist, period of rel high equality (wage compression etc)
	* i get the sense that he wants to go back to the keynesian golden ages
	* remember the gender equality issue in the fordist era, women expected to do domestic work etc
* how did this happen?
	* high degree of unionisation obvs (esp in manufacturing), biggest factor in income equality (compared to now)
	* my thoughts: the ontological question of skilled v unskilled.
		* cant separate it from the moral factor
		* we think skilled workers are inherently more deserving
		* but what does it really mean to be skilled? isnt it just that you're lucky enough to be able to command higher wages	
		* circular definition really
	* back then, rules were simple, "social contract" of the time that you could drp out of HS but as long as you had physical stamina (and male) could get a job in manufacturing, and do decently well
		* semi-skilled workers wages rising rel to skilled workers
	* now onto the OPEC crises, which produced two major deflations (i assume he's talking about 1971, 1973 stagflation?)
		* because of union power, the oil price increases translated into wage increase demands
		* and ofc volcker coup, birth of neoliberalism (jacked up interest rates) -> some details [here](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/note/839)
		* fed moved from fiscal to monetary policy
		* through 1980s, fall in inflation
		* and then ofc thatcher reagan
	* and ofc around the same time: technological revolution
		* my question is: is it a coincidence that it occured during the economic rev (TINA world)
		* or was it inevitable for timing reasons
		* semiconductor as general purpose technology which gets used in pretty much everything now
	* me: must remember what role technology plays in ec dev, from a marxist POV, productive forces, humanity mastery over nature
	* now we're moving toward knowledge economy, information age, computational-based production (capital) so less labour needed
	* now onto the soviet union??
		* people werent allowed to have computers??
		* collapse coincided with huge boom in tech
	* we're in an interesting situation now where education is so common, more so than ever before
		* but those who DON'T have access to education do much worse
		* education has become more of a stratifier, filter, new cleavage where society is divided into upper class (those who use uber deliveroo etc) and lower (those who work for them)
	* incentive changes??
		* since you can make a lot more money if you have tech skills?
		* physical skills no longer necessary
		* now people have huge incentives to raise level of their education (me: i hate thinking about this on an individual incentive level rather than structural collective level)
		* also potential for more group work, division of labour? communication/working togheter/social skills more and more important
		* i feel like he hasnt met a lot of silicon valley programmers lol
		* basically he's describing the shift from manual to cognitive labour but in many more words than necessary
	* during 1980s when manufacturing was doing badly, factories closed (not just up north in Manchester etc but also London)
		* worse in the US (rust belt) than it was here
		* but since 1990s things have reserved (big cities doing well cus of finance though lol)
		* me: is this really reversing (are things really getting better) when they're not producing anything socially valuable, is it sustainable, obvs not
		* him: the question is why this has come about
		* me: is it not finance lol
	* now going through arguments why this change has come about
	* q relating to goldin and katz, immigration important element (think immigration to SV)
		* ok now he's talking about taiwanese immigrants in silicon valley, also bangalore and india?
		* success of silicon valley due to immigrants
		* he's saying this aspect (skilled immigration) is neglected on this topic
	* me: is he going to mention entrepeneurial state?
	* him: we would have thought knowledge economy would have been period of massive innovation and growth
		* but growth has actually come right down and the question is really why
		* (me: growth is a bad measurement anyway and we should challenge that maybe that's an unhelpful take lol)
		* he admits that growth is higher in emerging economies than advanced
		* the q is the exent to which the latter growth is spillover effect of growth in advanced economies
	* the role of politics in allowing tech change to happen the way it did
		* denationalised
		* education policy that resulted in half of population going to higher education (political decision)
* now on urbanisation
	* cities have become v important in last 25 years or so
	* (me: cus of finance)
	* also house prices (me: also finance, he completely didnt talk about the role of big capital in keeping up house prices)
	* agglomeration
		* there's a question of why that's happening
		* (me: alec j ross talks about this, cant find quote tho)
	* mentioned thomas friedman's flat earth (big cities will disappear as info tech connects people)
		* since he wrote it, things have obvs gone in opposite direction (Smart people like to live/work together)
		* (me: remote work trend fighting against that but small in the grand scheme of things)
		* (also me: thoughts on trends at upper level of wages vs lower level, similar outcome but diff reasons)
		* "it would be slightly alarming if people could move wherever they want to move" because of a complex social norm/contract
			* "i'm not sure if i would feel confident making an agreement with you if you could just go off to whatever part of the world you want to"
			* how do you enforce trust, bargains etc
			* a lot of how the world works with today depends on long-term relationships
			* (me: why on earth is geographic proximity required for this)
			* he's very much of the need-to-be-together school (analogy to marriage)
			* capital wants people in the same place so they're easier to monitor and manage
			* on the agglomeration point, lots of things that cant be dispersed (care, services work)
			* me: it hasnt been automated yet just cus labour has been so cheap
	* the obvious management school reason: due to companies setting up offices in places where they know they can poach workers from other companies (skilled clusters)
	* q: why not small towns? literally who knows
		* now he's talking about assortative mating (assuming maximising based on lifetime household income)
		* highly educated people paired up etc (esp cus people meet in uni, or through social networks, homophily etc)
	* now he's talking about housing prices
		* he's not mentioning the extent to which that's buoyed by global capital? makes it seems like it's solely a matter of people wanting to live in the same city ...
		* geographical segregation develops as people who cant afford to live in london move out NO SHIT
	* "low-skilled workers physically needed"
		* ugh this conflation of care workers as low-skilled with all the moral judgments of that, should honestly use a new word
		* there's an imbrication with meritocracy
