### Readings

_(I didn't do the readings in advance because, well, I didn't know there were
any---I hadn't yet been offered a place in the course and so couldn't access it
through Moodle. But apparently you can view the reading list for any course at
LSE through [lse.rl.talis.com](https://lse.rl.talis.com/index.html). Seems like
there's a lot of overlap with [SO478](/SO478), which is convenient for me.)_

[Inequality: What Can Be Done?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23502970-inequality)
by Anthony B. Atkinson, introduction and chapter 1. 

[Capital in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century)
by Thomas Piketty, introduction and chapters 1-2.

### Lecture

* this course: primarily focused on income inequality in the OECD countries, and
  the political dimensions involved
* central question: why is there so much more income inequality in the US
  compared to countries (like Norway) in a similar state of economic
  development? we saw a whole parade of graphs with a lonely America always in
  the wrong part
* this class has been taught for a while but only gained popularity
  recently, as a result of the publication of Piketty's book lol
* the vicious cycle of income inequality: political policies are shaped by
  those who benefit from worsening inequality
* reasons we should care about inequality: health/social problems otherwise
* **predistribution** (market) vs **redistribution** (govt), though obviously
  government policy can affect predistribution as well
* (incidentally, wouldn't things be so much better if pre-tax income numbers
  were no longer a thing? like if the only numbers that could be used for
  anchoring were post-tax numbers? that would change this culturally ingrained
  assumption that the money receive is "your" money, and the government is
  "taking" it. not actually that farfetched, since the corporation already pays
  various fees/contributions on top of your paycheck anyway, and those number
  aren't included in your gross salary)
* "Piketty gets the headlines because he's this cool, good-looking French guy"
  (explaining that the work done for his book was also carried out by Saez and
  Atkinson, among others)
* some factors accounting for the recent rise of global inquality: tax havens,
  technology, market structure, secular capital growth (when r > g)
* rhetorical question: how is capitalism even allowed to exist in a democracy?
  (remember the fears of wealthy landowners---if the poor get to vote, they'll
  outlaw private property, etc.) my oversimplified Hot Take on this is that
  democracy is a spectrum, not a binary, and the extent to which capitalism is
  allowed to exist is precisely the extent to which the system is not
  democratic
* there's a huge gap between perceived and actual wealth distributions,
  especially in the US
* closing off with: we're living in a time of massive macroeconomic policy
  failure and people are angry, and they have every right to be; they just need
  to be angry at the _right people_. tbh I'm not sure if this is something the
  prof said or something I just jotted in my notebook, whoops

### Seminar

No seminar this week (probably since no one had been offered a place yet).
