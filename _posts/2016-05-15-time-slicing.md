I recently came across a [neat example of time-slice photography][inspiration],
which featured the Manhattan skyline over a period of 30 minutes around dusk.
It's a really cool technique that I've always wanted to try reproducing through
paint, since the nature of the medium means you could make the slices blend
together more seamlessly than would be possible in a photograph.

So that became my next art project: painting the Manhattan skyline as a
time-slice, preferably with both day and night shown. While searching for
source photographs, I found some gorgeous ones by photographer Dan Marker-Moore
on [PetaPixel] that I would have loved to use, but unfortunately none of them
were taken over a time period longer than 3 hours. Which is understandable,
because taking a photo from the same position every few minutes must get tiring
after a while.

So I'd have to make my own source photograph. That wasn't a problem, because I
found this beautiful timelapse video on YouTube:

<iframe width="1000" height="540"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDo73Njxdqc" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

I put that through [pleasetimeslicemyphotos.com](#jk) and got the following
result:

![Time-slice photo of the above video](http://i.imgur.com/ByuzR0a.png)


jk, I wish. As you can see, I _did_ manage to convert that video into a
time-slice photograph, but it was a rather involved and painful process that
took a lot longer than I expected. Read on to discover the exciting details.

### Taking screenshots with scrot

First, I installed the command-line screenshot application, `scrot`, which is a
great example of why abbreviations aren't always a good idea. I then started
the following bash script in a terminal window before starting the video in
fullscreen mode:

{% highlight bash %}
while true; do
    scrot;
    sleep 1;
done
{% endhighlight %}

Incidentally, this is approximately the longest bash script I am able to write
without wanting to bash my head on my keyboard. (Bash and I just don't get
along very well.) I also made the wise decision of writing it on one line, so I
could easily re-run the script if something went wrong. As it turns out, I did
have to run it multiple times, because I kept getting shown banner ads in the
Hudson river, which would be quite undignified in a painting.

Eventually, I obtained 40 1920x1080 PNG files, showing the Manhattan skyline at various
times of the day:

### Naive combining using ImageMagick +append

Now I just had to combine the images in a seamless way. For this, I used
[ImageMagick], which is a set of open-source command-line tools for image
manipulation. To make things simpler for myself, I installed the Python package
[Wand], which is a wonderful Python wrapper for ImageMagick that lets you do
stuff like this:

{% highlight python %}
from wand.image import Image

image = Image(filename='image.png')
image.crop(0, 0, 100, 100)
image.save(filename='image_cropped.png')
{% endhighlight %}

which, at least for me, is so much more pleasant than trying to remember the
syntax for bash.

My first attempt at joining the images was fairly inefficient, because I
saved all the cropped images to disk and joined them using the `convert
+append` tool in ImageMagick. The code has been shortened for brevity, but it
worked something like this:

{% highlight python %}
# Assume width & height are derived from the first image, and that the
# dimensions are the same for all images.
cropped_width = width / len(image_filenames)
start_x = 0

for image_filename in image_filenames:
    image = Image(filename=image_filename)
    image.crop(start_x, 0, start_x + cropped_width, height)

    # Assume cropped_filename is something like tmp_01.png for 01.png.
    image.save(filename=cropped_filename)
    start_x += cropped_width
{% endhighlight %}

Then, running `convert tmp_*.png output.png` would result in the following
image:

![Naive time-slice of the Manhattan skyline
photos](http://i.imgur.com/7r3rnrW.png)

Which isn't _bad_ -- in fact, it's exactly what I was trying to generate -- but
the slices look very obvious. If I could find a way to blend the slices more,
then I would get a better idea of what I needed to paint.

### Better combining using translucent images and compositing

My next thought was to make the slices overlap and blend them by making one
slice translucent at each edge, with the level of opacity relative to the
distance from the edge. This took a while to get working, and I had to draw a
lot of diagrams before I got all the pixel placements correct, but it was worth
it - the slices combined much more seamlessly as a result. I also realised that
it wasn't actually necessary to save the temporary images to disk, because Wand
provides a `composite()` method on Image instances that can take in other Image
instances.

This new approach looks like this (again, shortened for brevity; `width`,
`height`, and `cropped_width` are the same as before):

{% highlight python %}
# Use the first image as a base and draw all the other images onto it.
first_image = Image(filename=image_filenames[0])
for image_filename in image_filenames[1:]:
    # Crop out the portions of this image that will appear in the slice.
    image_piece = Image(filename=image_filename)
    end_x = start_x + cropped_width * 2
    image_piece.crop(start_x, 0, end_x, height)

    # For the first half of this slice, divide it into smaller slices at
    # varying opacity levels, with the number of slices determined by the
    # command-line argument args.slices_per_image.
    for slice_i in xrange(args.chunks_per_slice):
        slice_start_x = slice_i * slice_width

        # args.starting_alpha is a command-line argument and determines the
        # lowest opacity level; alpha_delta is computed from
        # args.starting_alpha and args.slices_per_image.
        slice_alpha_percent = args.starting_alpha + alpha_delta * slice_i
        slice_end_x = slice_start_x + slice_width

        slice_image = image_piece.clone()
        slice_image.crop(slice_start_x, 0, slice_end_x, height)
        if slice_alpha_percent < 100:
            make_translucent(slice_image, slice_alpha_percent)

        # Draw this translucent image onto the uncropped first image.
        first_image.composite(
            image=slice_image,
            left=start_x + slice_start_x,
            top=0
        )

    # Now draw the remaining half of this slice with full opacity.
    image_piece.crop(cropped_width, 0, cropped_width * 2, height)
    first_image.composite(
        image=image_piece,
        left=start_x + cropped_width,
        top=0
    )

    start_x += cropped_width
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how it works for this specific example. Since there are 40 images, and
the images are 1920 pixels wide, each sliced image needs to be -- or at least
appear to be -- 48 pixels wide. Now imagine that instead of placing the images
side by side, which would result in a visible edge between slices, we let them
overlap and blend them into each other. So for the first slice location, which
consists of the space between left=0px and left=48px, we would be able to see
both 01.png -- at full opacity -- _and_ 02.png -- not at full opacity. If we
chose a starting opacity level (`args.starting_alpha` in the code above) of,
say, 50%, and set `args.slices_per_image` to be 3, then the space between
left=0px and left=16px would show a blend of 01.png at full opacity and 02.png
at 50% opacity. Between left=16px and left=32px, we would have 01.png at full
opacity and 02.png at 75% opacity. Between left=32px and left=48px, we would
have 01.png at full opacity and 02.png at 100% opacity. The same idea would be
repeated for all 40 slice locations, with slice location 40 only consisting of
40.png at full opacity (since there's nothing to blend into).

By varying the parameters for the starting opacity and number of slices per
image, we can drastically change how smooth the final image looks. Here's how
it looks with 3 slices per image and a starting opacity level of 50%:

![A slightly smoother Manhattan skyline, though still
blocky](http://i.imgur.com/UDCheUJ.png)

And if we up the slices per image to 12 and reduce the starting opacity level
to 10%, it looks even smoother -- you can barely see the edges now:

![An even smoother Manhattan skyline](http://i.imgur.com/0AeEWLK.png)

For reference, the image shown near the beginning of this post was created with
24 slices per image and a starting opacity level of 0%. Incidentally, here's
how that image looked when reversed, with the same parameters (please ignore
the notification on the bottom left):

![Reversed Manhattan skyline - night on the left, day on the
right](http://i.imgur.com/z0qpZXh.png)

If you're wondering why all the number of slices I tried are a multiple of 3,
it's because the image comes out weird if the widths and positions are not
whole numbers (you just get lines in random places).

### Time-slicing the process of painting

Now that I had a script for time-slicing any arbitrary sequence of photos, the
logical next step was to find more photos to try this on. The most obvious
candidates were the vanity photos that I took to document the process of
creating various paintings. Unfortunately, none of these time-slices turned out
very well, partly because the original photos were very inconsistent in terms
of lighting and positioning, and also because my painting process is much less
elegant than the Manhattan skyline.

#### Cape Town painting

Please excuse the blurriness and the bad cropping.

#### Swan painting

This one came out really badly because the most detailed part of the painting
is the swan, which happens to be in the middle of the canvas:

### The full script

If you have photos of your own that you want to try time-slicing, you can find
the full script [on GitHub][gist]. Note that the script expects your image
files to be in a subdirectory "raw" within another subdirectory, and sorts the
images by name (so 01.png, 02.png, 03.png, etc). For example, I had a
subdirectory named "nyc", and within that, the subdirectory "raw" housed the
original 40 PNG files; I would run `python timeslice.py nyc` and the output
image would appear within the "nyc" folder.

I've tested the script with Python 2.7.10 on Ubuntu. Not sure if it will work
on other platforms. The only other dependency is [Wand], which itself requires
ImageMagick.

I'd love to see what you do with this -- tweet me [@dellsystem] if you've made
a cool time-slice image or if have ideas for improving the blending technique!

### Addendum

#### The skyline painting

I got so caught up in the technical details of making the original time-slice
image that I completely forgot that I was supposed to paint the Manhattan
skyline. Check back soon for the results. It'll probably look a lot like the
first image, only less detailed, and without the "rumble virals" logo.

#### Alternative solutions

Apparently there's a way of doing this within [Photoshop]. I don't have
Photoshop, so I can't test it, but I suspect it would be slower and a bit more
hands-on than my method. I'm not sure how you'd do blending, either.

#### Copyright issues

The Manhattan skyline photos shown in this post are courtesy of [Rumble Viral],
and were used in the spirit of fair use. If you plan on creating your own time
slices and using them commercially, you'll probably want to get permission from
the copyright holder for the original images.
