### Readings

#### [Media and Morality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/969171.Media_and_Morality) by Roger Silverstone (chapter 6)

On hospitality and justice. I thought this was quite a good read . Incidentally, Silverstone was a founder of the Media and Communications at LSE!

* hospitality should be a key virtue of the mediapolis
  * basically means an obligation to listen
  * you need this if you want true media justice
  * quoting Derrida on ethics: hospitality as an ethic, not a right
    * it's about welcoming the other without demanding reciprocity
    * not quite the same as tolerance, which is really just protective, scrutinised hospitality
  * dangerous but necessary part of cosmopolitanism
* existing media is based on conditional hospitality (contingent on good behaviour)
* the internet: hospitality without a host; open, but no one takes responsibility for the welcome (cool way of thinking about it)
* how to prevent abuse of hospitality: one forfeits the right to hospitality if one denies it to others
  * how this should be implemented is left deliberately vague
* on Rawls
  * media justice requires no distortion (as that leads to systematic exclusion)
  * we have to go beyond Rawls, toward **responsibility** over justice
  * justice in Rawls' formulation is procedural, with an emphasis on the means
  * which can undermine individuals' own sense of responsibility
* references Zygmunt Bauman's book [Postmodern Ethics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360937.Postmodern_Ethics)
  * morality can only emerge from an existing social order
  * by taking individual responsibility we can transcend societal norms and thus redefine justice
  * society and collective thinking seduce us away from morality
  * thus we need to frame moral responsibility as individual, not collective/procedural
* [Hans Jonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Jonas) on the spatial concerns of moral responsibility
  * formal: taking responsibility for our own acts
  * substantive: taking responsibility even for the acts of others (like politicians being responsible for citizens or parents being responsible for their children)---non-reciprocal
* distinction between obligations (with the provider being the agent) and rights (with the claimant being the agent)
  * obligations-based approach better than rights-based approach because it preserves responsibility?
  * every right has a corresponding obligation
  * but there are "imperfect obligations" that don't have corresponding rights
* to sum up: a procedural approach is insufficient
  * institutions become reified, with unforeseen consequences
  * individuals put faith in institutions at the cost of ceding their own personal responsibility
  * the media is key for shaping citizens' view of world (think about the etymology of "mediated")
* my thoughts on this: it's a complicated balance between trying to be hospitable and knowing when not to be hospitable
  * you do need a platform that is welcoming to unheard voices if you want a shot at correcting injustice
  * on the other hand, we're in a situation today where some voices are being given a platform when they perhaps shouldn't be (think: Nazis)

#### [Media Concentration and Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/318552.Media_Concentration_and_Democracy) by C. Edwin Baker (chapter 1)

Published in 2006. On the need for a less concentrated media landscape. I agree with a lot of his points about media concentration but I worry that his solution isn't radical enough ...

* the term "fourth estate" (which refers to the press/journalism) derives from a historical European concept of the three estates of the realm (clergy, nobility, commoners)---not formally part of the political system, but with the potential to shape it
* the main argument: more concentrated media ownership is bad for democracy
  * normative view of democracy as an end in itself (equality, autonomy), not merely a means
  * the media as the most important institutional structure of the public sphere, influences ideology and thus voting behaviour (mediates relationship between public & govt)
  * thus a country's level of democracy depends on the extent to which the media is egalitarian
  * it's not that we should try to have complete equality of views/opinions (we can't)---having specialists is a good thing
* the FCC used to disperse media ownership but they've recently relaxed rulings 
  * Baker believes that ownership dispersal should be a basic constitutional process, separate from the actual content of the media (his is a proceduralist approach)
* Berlusconi effect: referring to Silvio Berlusconi, who controlled much of the media in Italy and managed to get elected as PM twice
* the main reason you'd want more independent media players:
  * less decentralised = less chance of corruption (theoretically---it's easier to buy off one person than many)
* market failures that arise when media is too concentrated
  * even non-readers benefit from investigative journalism (since one result is injustices that are more accountable, less corrupt) but they may not be paying the newspaper
    * thus inadequate profit-based incentive to do important work
  * Baker mentions that newspapers tend to have high operating profits (since the goods they sell have low marginal costs, and the value of their brand is protected by IP law)---this was published before the rise of Facebook, though, and things have changed quite a bit since then
  * the ideal scenario: newspapers reinvest more of their profits into producing high-quality journalism
    * in fact, newspapers that are controlled by journalists tend to do exactly this whereas publicly-traded ones tend to cave into shareholder pressure
    * less focus on short term profits -> positive externalities in the long term
  * dispersal should reduce the incidence of conflicts of interest with advertisers (as each individual paper should have fewer advertisers to care about)
  * cross-ownership might save money in the short term but deleterious effects: repetition, reducing competition
  * basically he's saying that capitalism is bad for the media and thus for democracy/society (as there is a divergence between "profitable" and "public interest" yeah no shit)

#### [Speaking for Ourselves](https://www.thenation.com/article/speaking-ourselves/) in The Nation

By Makani Themba and Nan Rubin. A short article on media portrayal during the civil rights era & its impact on racism in real life.

### Lecture

* today: understanding Rawls' influence in ideas on media dispersal / media justice movement
* some staggering stats on media concentration in the US (not sure of the source)
  * in 1983, 30 corporations controlled 90% of the media
  * in 2012, it was just 6 corporations (Viacom, News Corporation, Comcast, CBS, Time Warner, Disney)
* Baker's approach w/ maximum dispersal is wholly procedural (Ã  la Rawls)
  * he's concerned about: democratic distribution / structural risk / quality control
  * in his view, media markets are a special kind of market and tend towards market failure
    * basically they under-produce high-quality goods (positive externalities)
    * (I would argue that they are a fairly standard kind of market but otherwise sure)
  * this is a normative framework: he's establishing a benchmark to aspire to, not necessarily based on empirical evidence
  * he assumes that dispersal will automatically lead to less homogenous content
  * also doesn't really address the degree to which even a dispersed media landscape will still be corrupted by the profit motive (sorta abstracts it away)
* Silverstone's approach is very different---instead of Baker's state-run media justice approach, he's all about hospitality, responsibility, and individual moral obligation
  * he has a great quote on regulation being like grammar: it's not enough to rely on that in order to truly flourish, you need norms as well
  * context of his writing: post-9/11 and Iraq war, when representation of non-Western cultures in the media was a hot topic
* the Media Justice Movement: telling the stories of underrepresented people within a commercial framework
  * relates to Young's ideas on how to challenge the proceduralist vision

### Seminar

* comparing/contrasting different approaches
  * the Hutchins report seemed to assume that the morality piece was _already_ in journalism as a collective
  * whereas Silverstone wary of collective morality (since that can be used as an excuse) and more focused on the individual
  * neither really addresses what to do about the overarching profit motive & its effects on journalism
  * Silverstone also ignores the oppressed/oppressor distinction, whereas Freire puts the burden on the oppressed
  * also Silverstone mostly neglects to discuss larger structural forces that can dampen an individual's desire to do good (THE PROFIT MOTIVE I know I'm a broken record)
