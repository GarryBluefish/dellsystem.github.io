### Lecture

Given by [Nicola Lacey](http://www.lse.ac.uk/law/people/academic-staff/nicola-lacey), School Professor of Law, Gender and Social Policy in LSE's Department of Law

* her specialty is criminal law
* criminality has a lot to do with inequality because it comes from this standpoint of justice etc but ofc we know the least well-off members tend to be affected the most
* reconciling feminism and "underreprsentation" of women in prosecution
* equality instruments always implemented with words (legislation etc)
* today: equality and discrim from a legal perspective
	* equality act 2010, just the TOC, very complicated and structured
	* US 1868, 14th amendment, equal protection clause: no state shall make laws abrdiging privileges of citizens + deprive right to life/liberty/property w/o due process
	* key question when it comes to legal guarantees of equality: who does it pertain to? especially relevant in the US case
* european human rights convention 1950/3, article 14, sets out equality w/o discrimination, but only where relevant to the rights set out in THIS convention
	* also remember that a lot of these conventions/constitutions etc came as the result of upheaval
	* US civil war, WWII
* CEDAW:
	* states who accept convention commit to ending discrimination against women (by anyone) in various ways
* equality act: protected characteristics include
	* age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation
	* also political affiliation is missing which is a tricky one tbf (what counts as politics ... as for any characteristic that is a choice, there has to be some nuance that looks at the intent behind that choice)
	* often the specific chars chosen depend on perceived social problems (eg religion originally in NI but ot england/wales until lately)
	* the question here is: does one regulatory regime fit all of these types of discriminations with very diff histories
	* there are specific exemptions carved out for specific types of age discrim, like forced retirement age
	* notably social class (or other economic factors) omitted, like in most legislation
	* also note that it's gender reasignment not allowing gender identity (like nonbinary), law is great at producing ambiguity but doesnt like to acknowledge its existence
* def of direct discrimination: treating someone less favourably due to their protected characteristic
	* ambiguity over because: can it be unintentional or does it have to be deliberate
* indirect: accumulated rules, practices, institutions, applied formally neutrally but in practice result in exclusion etc when you dont have a good reason ("effects discrim")
	* eg height requirements would discriminate based on sex despite seeming neutrality in terms of protected chars
	* have to show that it's not a "proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"
		* eg firm having white men at the top because they get a biz advantage cus their clients like that (currently treated as illegal but the line is fuzzy, lots of discretion on part of judge)
* note that although discrim is illegal under this act, damages are usualy small and only if intent can be shown
	* and recall the "proportionate means" & "legitimate aim" lots of room for leeway
* quote by anatole france: law forbids rich as well as poor to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, steal bread
	* formal inequality can ofc disguise or rationalise substantive ineq
	* can we move from treatment as an equal toward actual legal treatment
	* opps or outcomes?
	* resources, welfare, wellbeing, capabilities?
* concepts of legislation against discrim
	* status (lack of formal equality)
	* direct (disparate treatment)
	* indirect (disparate impact)
	* reverse discrim (compensation for past discrim, affirm action etc)
	* right now, lots of practical difficulties in actually having quotas or anything DUE TO equality law
* q for nicola on whether things have changed since her article was published ~30 years ago
	* legal regime hasnt really changed tho a few things have expanded
	* she thinks it might have gotten worse, harder to enforce laws at the low level cus of labour market changes

### Seminar

* how are equality/discrim related to each other
	* antidiscrim is a subset but not sufficient condition for equality
* is the law capable of encoding adequate conception of equality
	* there are some areas where it fails esp more private areas like household but can have symbolic effect even if unenforceable
* assessing potential of law
	* who is covered? citizens etc
	* who can access it
	* who implements it and how much leeway do they have
	* gaps in whats included or not
	* law can itself be a mechanism for ineq eg property rights
