### Readings

#### [(Not) Getting Paid to Do What You Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32714186-not-getting-paid-to-do-what-you-love) by Brooke Erin Duffy (chapter 3)

Described as

> An illuminating investigation into a class of enterprising women aspiring to “make it” in the social media economy but often finding only unpaid work

in the press materials. Didn't read.

#### [Labor in the Global Digital Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21929312-labor-in-the-global-digital-economy) by Ursula Huws (chapter 5)

Going to read this at some point for my dissertation.

Same as above

### Lecture

On the subjects of the digital world. Introducting basic Marxist theories of class & exploitation and applying them to the digital economy, without too much explicit mention of Marx (presumably to avoid the associated semantic baggage).

* there is a dialectical opposition of the working & the capitalist class (collective categories, not individualistic)
* historical examples of class struggle:
  * welfare state (power resources theory)
  * 2-day weekends (won by workers)
  * deregulation of finance (won by capitalist class)
  * the creation of the EU (born out of the former [European Coal and Steel Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community), but really a victory for the German industrial capitalist class)
* on Bourdieu's theory of taste (cultural class signifiers, where what is considered "high culture" is at least partly determined by the ruling class)
* one way to think about class is based on income bracket, but there's a better way: relationship to the means of production
  * the easiest way to distinguish: capitalist class sees more income more capital; proletarian, from wages
* pre-capitalism, workers (by and large) had ownership of tools needed for production; there was no concept of "unemployment"
  * but capitalism brought about the separation of workers from their tools, in a process called [**primitive accumulation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital)
  * result: workers need to sell their labour-power in order to survive
* **exploitation** refers to the general process of capitalists selling goods for more than the worker is paid in wages + is needed for raw materials (the extracted value is called **surplus value**)
* of course, this is a fairly crude analysis
  * to be more sophisticated, we'd need intermediate classes, and we'd also have to allow liminality
  * there are high-tech workers who are getting paid (high) wages but also often have stock or at least options, which can realise high capital gains
  * we also have middle managers, who ofte promote the class interests of capital even though they're usually compensated like workers
  * plus, within the capitalist class, we have different categories: industrial/financial/platform which may have opposed views on topics like the deregulation of finance
* **operaismo**, or ["workerism" in Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workerism): emphasises the centrality of the working class
  * implies that we need to look at the composition of the working class as well
  * technical composition, based on: division of labour; management techniques; machinery; reproduction of labour
  * political composition, based on: self-organising structures (unions and political parties); direct action (strikes, vandalism)
  * operaismo accepts that the composition (technical and political)  can change along with the economy, in various cycles
* the Fordist cycle, from 1920s-1970s:
  * assembly lines
  * Taylorist management (deskilled workers given as little control over their work as possible; atomised work units)
  * huge factory machinery (high capital investment)
  * high wages (in order to boost consumption) assuming a male breadwinner model (women at home, doing domestic labour)
  * trade unions divided by industry
  * primary tactic: strikes
  * theory: political composition is determined by technical composition
    * due to centralisation of factories, it's easy to have a strike that can shut down a nerve centre in a particular industry
    * plus, workers tended to be somewhat homogenous (similarly skilled, male, brought together in factories so they build solidarity that way)
   * (there's a great article in [Catalyst](https://catalyst-journal.com/) called [Management-By-Stress](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/s/management-by-stress) which sees the move from Fordism to Toyotism as a way to deprive workers of these "pressure points")
* do we have a new worker subjectivity now, due to changes in technology?
  * free labour for the advertising-driven UGC platforms (Facebook/Google/etc): not really
    * (thought: in Marxist terms, is there actually value being produced, or is the more targeted advertising just reducing the cost of circulation in the market?)
  * gig economy workers
    * precarious work
    * digitally managed via app (as opposed to an actual living employer)
    * rarely get to meet each other in person, unless they happen to pass each other by on the street or at waiting points
    * otoh, [they are starting to organise](http://politicalcritique.org/world/2017/precarious-couriers-are-leading-the-struggle-against-platform-capitalism/) and using some clever strategies, so there's hope
  * content moderators for platforms like FB
    * outsourced to low-wage areas like the Philippines
    * checking for pornographic/violent content
    * high turnover -> harder to organise
  * Amazon warehouse workers
    * product sales cycle highly seasonal (higher Q4 revenue due to Christmas shopping)
    * in order to keep up with this seasonal demand, they have hired a mobile workforce which they call a ["CamperForce"](http://mashable.com/2014/11/30/amazon-holiday-labor-seniors/#IPpq5fSsDsqz)
    * basically elderly/retired workers who own their own RVs and who may have lost assets in the financial crisis
  * Coltan mining in the DRC (necessary to produce electronics)---[Christian Fuchs](http://www.polecom.org/index.php/polecom/article/view/19/195) writes about this a lot
  * software engineers/data scientists who are in high demand (partly as a result of overaccumulation, tbh) and thus can command high salaries
    * this is very cushy cognitive work, in environments that are intellectually challenging
    * they're getting paid well so they have no reason to question the status quo (at least as a class)
* on class divisions today
  * cognitariat: selling intellectual labour-power (as opposed to the proletariat which sold physical labour-power)
    * highly educated (overeducated) workers with lots of cultural capital who will likely end up in precarious work
    * (Yann Moulier-Boutang makes an illuminating distinction between the intellectual & physical labour power in [Cognitive Capitalism](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/note/2364): whereas physical labour-power is, in a sense, "destroyed" in the process, intellectual labour-power builds upon itself as the owner of it accumulates greater skill and know-how)
  * the ["multitude"](http://www.generation-online.org/t/negriESF.htm): affective/common labour, connected by digital networks, building commons
    * peer production as an example---don't need capitalists
    * ofc this is a very optimistic account that abstracts away material elements (not everyone benefits)
* the concept of **surplus populations** (aka [reserve army of labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour)) is useful for understanding the future of labour
  * people who will be excluded from work due to automation (and other factors)
  * unemployed, marginalised in labour market
  * (this is his research focus right now)
* no focus on the platform capitalist class today; instead, focusing on those below
