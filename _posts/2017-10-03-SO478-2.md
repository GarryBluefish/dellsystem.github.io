### Readings

#### [Income inequality in the developing world](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/851.full) by Martin Ravallion

Summary: income inequality in developing world less than 30 years ago, but this
is mostly due to falling inequality _between_ countries (as those on the
bottom, esp China, catch up) whereas inequality _within_ countries is slowly
rising (though flat since 2000).

* since the start of developmental economics in the 50s, inequality was seen as
  unavoidable, a secondary concern to growth; it was feared that to reduce
  inequality was to reduce growth (Rawls' difference principle was often used
  to justify this POV)
* overall inequality measures in the developing world usually pool together
  every single person, ignoring country boundaries (and thus obviously
  obscuring different trends)
* **mean-log deviation**: a scale-invariant measure of inequality (like all
  relative inequality measures)
  * log(mean income/household income per person), then take the mean of that
  * unlike Gini coefficient, it's linearly decomposable by population subgroups
    (e.g., rural vs urban, or North vs South, or whatever you want to
    measure)---you can add the subgroup MLD values together to get the overall
    MLD value
  * measured with household surveys (and the obvious caveats apply there)
  * in 2010, the overall developing world MLD was 0.578
    * to illustrate what this means: if we had 3 people, one had an income of
      $1 and one had an income of $2, the third would need an income of over
      $12
* we usually focus on relative inequality, but absolute inequality is also
  important
  * recent perceptions of rising inequality are likely because we _think_ in
    terms of absolute inequality, even if we measure in terms of relative
  * these are just different value judgments, one is not necessarily better
    than the other
  * for an absolute inequality measure, we need translation invariance
  * to illustrate the difference between abs/rel: if we find that growth does
    not change the share of income going to the poor, this does not mean an
    equal distribution of the income gains ... given existing inequality, the
    rich will of course have greater absolute income gains
    * made-up example for my own edification: if the bottom 50% gets 10% of the
      income, and growth means that instead of $100 in total national income
      it's now $120, then, assuming unchanging relative inequality, the bottom
      50% will get $12 instead of $10, whereas the top 50% get $108 instead of
      $90
    * so the wealthy benefit a LOT more from growth unless relative inequality
      decreases substantially
    * and clearly this has major implications for the economy ... scary

#### [Who are the Global Top 1%](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/771271476908686029/Segal.pdf) by Sudhir Anand and Paul Segal

* study that uses a combination of survey and tax data to examine the global
  top 1% from 1988 to 2012
  * primarily from advanced economies (85%) but that percentage is falling
  * using wealth trackers by Forbes, Credit Suisse
* unlike the "global middle class", the global rich are closer to constituting
  a class in themselves: converging culturally (somewhat), travelling to the
  same places, going to the same events (Davos), sharing financial knowledge
* the 2012 threshold: $50k USD per capita in household income (which seems
  exceptionally low to me---it's right around the median US household
  income---but I guess that's just false consciousness on my part)
  * Brazil has 1.5% of its population in the top 1%, which is the most of any
    developing country; in the developed world, it's usually 4-8%
* for the global top 10%, the threshold is $15k USD per capita in household
  income (60% of the US and 70% of Switzerland are in here)
* there is no evidence that people at the economic bottom within a country
  benefit from their compatriots getting into the top 1% ...
  * equivalently, having more women or minorities joining the elite class will
    not fix things; it will not embolden rather than challenge the power
    structure
* purchasing power parity adjustments for the global top 1% (which is, for the
  most part, a jetsetting class) is tricky---which country's rates of PPP do
  you adjust with?
* thresholds change if you use wealth instead of income (per adult):
  * $710k USD per adult for the top 1% by household (wow)
  * in 2012, US citizens comprised 36% of the global top 1% by wealth; China
    3%, and India 0.5%
* most income in the top 1% comes from salary/labour rather than capital gains
  (senior professionals, business owners: "supermanagers")
  * tend to be senior executives who have more in common with each other than
    with their fellow countrymen

#### [Global Income Distribution](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/LISCenter/brankoData/wber_final.pdf) by Christoph Lakner and Branko Milanovic

Published in the The World Bank Economic Review. I have my own feelings on the
World Bank but I'll try to leave them aside when writing this review.

* surveys of household income in the developing world, 1988-2012
  * surveys over tax record data because it's too sparse and unreliable in
    developing countries
  * still, these surveys have a tendency to underestimate inequality
* China as an outlier that skews overall stats, due to its huge population and
  unusual economic history: obviously its top incomes are quite high, but still
  a large middle class was lifted out of poverty

### Lecture

Given by [Dr Sudhir
Anand](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/faculty-research/skoll/knowledge-generation/applied-research/oxford-impact-0/researcher-profiles-0/dr-sudhir-anand),
Professor of Economics at Oxford University, who co-authored one of the papers
above. The lecture he delivered is primarily a summary of that paper.

* there's a common perception (partly pioneered by the financial crisis &
  resultant Occupy-type movements) that economic growth and globalisation have
  resulted in higher levels of inequality, hence the reason we study it
  * recent announcement by the World Economic Forum that severe income
    inequality is a big problem (or, as the New York Times put, it ["Davos Elite Fret About Inequality Over Vintage Wine and Canapés"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-davos-backlash.html)
  * some more stuff from people who helped to create the situation we're in now:
    * Christine Lagarde: ["Excessive inequality is corrosive to growth; it is corrosive to society."](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp012313)
    * Credit Suisse has done lots of research into wealth inequality, top 1%
* wealth inequality is obviously higher than for income
  * at the upper end, we have stats for billionaires; more and more are coming
    from developing countries recently (which is, let's just say, probably not
    great for those at the bottom in those countries)
  * at the lower end, of course, we have lots of people living in extreme
    poverty (usually defined as around a dollar a day---$1.25 USD as of 2008,
    as defined by the World Bank). incidentally, the fact that we define it in
    terms of a dollar amount per day (as opposed to access to particular
    services) speaks to the completeness with which capitalist realism and the
    hegemony of free markets have permeated our lives and transformed the way
    we think
* why do we care about global inequality?
  * some people (mostly living in rich countries) seem to think that justice
    should stop at country borders, as if these arbitrary and artificial
    constructs should delimit the boundaries of our ethical concerns
  * others recognise that reducing poverty globally should be a concern if we
    are to care about poverty at all
  * plus there's the inconvenient truth that rich countries have benefited from
    globalisation at the expense of poor countries
    * consider the net transfers of wealth FROM the developing world TO the
      developed world throughout history, from the era of colonialism to the
      era of the Washington Consensus (Jason Hickel, in LSE's anthropology
      dept, has written an excellent post on this for [The
      Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries))
    * a variety of international social arrangements help preserve the
      dominance of already-developed countries (think trade agreements,
      environmental concerns, attitudes toward debt)
    * hence the developed world has a moral responsibility to fix things (per
      Amartya Sen's _The Idea of Justice_)
* for a thorough analysis, we'll need to separate out inequalities _within_
  countries and inequalities _between_ countries (can't just lump them all into
  one)

#### Different methodological approaches

* Concept 0: between countries, using national income as the ranking variable and
either the USD or PPP-adjusted dollars as the numéraire
* Concept 1: between countries, using national income per capita as the ranking
  variable and PPP$
* Concept 2: between individuals, using national income per capita as the
  ranking variable and PPP$
* Concept 3: between individuals, using actual household income per capita as
  the ranking variable and PPP$

The reason we care about national income on its own (not just per capita) is
because it has some influence on a country's authority and power when
negotiating trade agreements and the like.

On PPP adjustments: obviously problematic in the sense of reducing a
multidimensional vector to a scalar. Takes a typical "basket of goods" but of
course the definition of that is subjective and, in the end, politically
motivated (whether consciously or not). The same problem that arises when
thinking about inflation.

On scaling household size: tricky topic with lots of different approaches and
factors to consider (economies of scale, varying consumption patterns, cultural
norms, etc). No real way to equalise across households so most research just
makes assumptions about what a "household" means and isn't too worried about
how that aligns with reality.

China is an equalising force for concepts 1-3, but disequalising for concept 0
(because its national income is so high, and growing; but of course its
national income per capita is still quite low).

For the paper, they looked at three different indices: Gini, MLD (also known as
Theil L) and Theil T. The latter two are additively decomposable (not just into
two components, but into any number, with weights). Incidentally, you can use
variance as a measure of inequality; it's just going to be an absolute measure,
not a relative one.

Global Gini right now is 0.70,, which is much higher than in any individual
country (speaks to how high inter-country inequality is right now).

### Seminar

This was the first official seminar with our permanent seminar groups (last
week was fairly ad-hoc). Focused on introductions (who we are, where we're
from, and some thoughts on inequality within our own countries). I talked about
China (since Canada was taken) and its very unique position within the global
inequality hierarchy: on one level, it's been responsible for reducing
worldwide income inequality via the lifting of such a large number of people
out of poverty, but on another level income inequality is still staggeringly
high. The rural-urban gap (which is responsible for, by some estimates, 10% of
economic inequality within the country) is especially worrying, and I could see
its consequences when I was living in Beijing---I, along with most of my
international school friends, had various housekeepers during my time there,
and they tended to be young women from rural areas (mostly Sichuan in my case)
who gave up pretty much all their free time to live in someone else's house and
take care of the household while being paid a pittance. Which says something
about their economic and social prospects where they came from. Among mainland
citizens, 1% of the population controls 1/3 of all the wealth, which is quite
scary.

Another thing to consider with China is its tumultuous recent history. During
the Great Leap Forward, economic inequality was presumably lower, but a lot of
people (especially my parents' generation) were incredibly poor ... It's kind
of obvious, but still deserves to be said: we can't focus just on inequality
measures when trying to understand the health of an economy. Any discussion of
inequality ought to be accompanied by its proper geopolitical context, not to
mention the level of economic development.

Some interesting statistics on inequality brought up by the other students:

* South Africa: 60% of income owned by top 10%; worse than most countries, and
  growing (even since 2008)
  * huge racial element to this of course
  * 30/55 million people live in poverty
  * unemployment at either 28% or 36% with the expanded definition (which
    includes those who are no longer looking for work)
  * under the age of 35, unemployment is at 70%
  * poverty declining due to social assistance grants
  * only 7 million people actually earn enough to pay income tax
  * the ratio of police:citizens is a great way to look at wealth disparities
    between cities: one wealthy, predominantly white town is 38:1 with very
    little crime, whereas a poor, predominantly black town will be closer to
    1:1400 (with an exceptionally higher crime rate)
* Sweden: has been quite equal for a while, but inequality is (slowly) rising
  lately
  * the interesting thing about Sweden is that their economy was primarily
    agricultural for a while, but after some massive famines a lot of their
    population emigrated to the US
  * as a result, Sweden ended up creating a state modeled after the American
    one at the time
  * they never had a neoliberal drive à la Reagan/Thatcher so maybe that
    explains why things are so good now
* Ireland: most unequal in the EU pre-tax, but around average post-tax
  * has about 6 billionaires on Forbes' list, several of whom appear to be
    residents for tax purposes ...
  * recent poll proposing a tax bracket of 60% for incomes of 100k EUR; 60%+ in
    favour (awesome)
* London: most unequal part of the UK, driven by the wealth of the richest
  rather than the poverty of the poorest (the poor in London are generally
  doing better than elsewhere)
  * 90:10 ratio of 4:1. income fell post-crash, at a roughly similar level
    across the board (thus preserving the ratio)
  * most wealth in the form of property
  * housing crisis has been happening for ages but only really reported about
    since 2010 (when it started affecting journalists, presumably)
  * the construction of social housing has dropped 90% since 2010; instead, we
    have the cruelly-named "affordable" housing (usually 80% of local market
    rent which is still ridiculously high)
