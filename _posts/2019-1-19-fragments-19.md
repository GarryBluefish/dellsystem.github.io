In the wake of the announcement that tech villain extraordinaire Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie are filing for divorce, there's been a flurry of thinkpieces over how much money MacKenzie should walk away with.

After all, Jeff Bezos owns 16% of Amazon, which is valued at over $100 billion, and given that Washington state is a "community property" state (where assets accumuluated during marriage are communally owned by the couple), MacKenzie should technically be entitled to half of that.

But there's a difference between "legally entitled to" and "justly deserves". There are some pretty cruel and/or misogynistic arguments for MacKenzie getting none of it, because it's all _his_ wealth, and she should just be grateful she had someone to take care of her during her marriage. He did the _real_ work to make Amazon a success, whereas all she did was stay at home and raise the kids, etc. (I'm not going to link to any of these takes, because they're all terrible.)

The main counter-argument that I've seen is the liberal feminist one. For example, Jill Filipovic writes for [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/12/mackenzie-bezos-divorce-jeff-why-she-deserves-wealth-money-husband) that MacKenzie deserves half his Amazon wealth, partly because she helped her husband start Amazon (she was an [early employee](https://www.wired.com/story/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-lone-genius-myth/)), and partly because she took care of raising the kids in her husband's absence (making sacrifices in her own career to do so).

There's definitely some merit to that argument. It's true that the waged work/domestic work split, which is highly gendered, is also highly unequal - the former is considered "productive" and valued both materially and ideologically, while the latter is seen as not deserving of pay and often denigrated as a result (think how "welfare mom" is used as a slur). Obviously, both production and [social reproduction](https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/social-reproduction-theory-ferguson/) are necessary for capitalism to function; without the latter, there is no workforce of tomorrow, much less in 20 years' time. But one is valorised, while one is not, even within individual household. So arguing that MacKenzie Bezos deserves half her husband's share of Amazon is, if nothing else, a way to push back against flawed and sexist assumptions around where value is created.

But it's also _liberal_ feminism, and I do mean that as a criticism. Even as it contests the idea that MacKenzie played no part in her husband's success, it doesn't challenge the much more insidious claim that they as a _couple_ deserve to be "worth" over $100 billion. Like, it's 2019; we all know that [economic inequality](/posts/fragments-14) is really horrendously bad right now. And we also know the [dark human costs](https://www.thenation.com/article/heike-geissler-seasonal-associate-amazon/) of Amazon's meteoric rise. Surely it's irresponsible journalism to so much as talk about Jeff Bezos' net worth unless you also acknowledge the injustice and illegitimacy of that wealth.

And yet there is an entire Guardian op-ed pontificating on how Jeff Bezos and his wife should split their $100+ billion amongst themselves, without so much as a mention of _what that money represents_. It's taken for granted that 16% of Amazon is theirs, and they just need to figure out how to divvy that up between themselves. Like, sure, recognising women's work is important, but if that's the beginning and end of your argument in a context where you're literally discussing the richest man on earth, then it's not worth the HTML page it's displayed on.

It's infuriating, because it's a distraction. MacKenzie Bezos doesn't need or deserve more money, and she doesn't deserve our sympathy, either. Sure, let her have half of her husband's share of Amazon. It reduces inequality somewhat, at least. Still, it's hardly worth applauding, except as an example of a blatant exercise of power: as founder and CEO, he was able to retain a large part of his founding shares while also setting the terms by the vast majority of his workers get [barely any](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17934194/amazon-minimum-wage-raise-stock-options-bonus-warehouse). There's no innovation or ingenuity to be lauded here; it's just plain old exploitation.

What makes this whole thing tricky to reason about (especially from a Marxist perspective) is the fact that most of their wealth is in shares. The stock market is a complex thing to grasp, in Marxist terms; it's not _exactly_ surplus value, but it is related to it, in a non-obvious way. Amazon didn't actually turn a profit for a really long time - its strategy was to reinvest in expanding its business - but its stock did pretty well even then, because investors were on board with the strategy (and realised that its successful pursuit of growth was bound to pay off eventually). So whatever the net worth of Jeff Bezos' Amazon stock, you can't say it was _directly_ stolen from workers through good old-fashioned Marxist exploitation; instead, it's more like an approximation of that exploitation. It's a function of that exploitation that incorporates a whole bunch of other variables, not all of which make sense.

One way to think of it as a metaphor. I just started reading [Cultures of Financialization: Fictitious Capital in Popular Culture
and Everyday Life](https://maxhaiven.com/2014/01/10/cultures-of-financialization/) by Max Haiven (really excellent, by the way - a good blend of academic sources & gorgeous, not-too-dense prose), and the first chapter suggests thinking about the worth of financial assets in terms of metaphor:

> [...] just as the meaning of a metaphor is suspended between and part of a linguistic ecology made up of multiple claims to meaning, so, too, are the prices of financial assets suspended within financial markets made up of multiple competing claims to value. While all financial assets may claim to be a real representation of underlying “real-world” values, they are, in fact, inter-referential within their own economy of meaning. While all financial assets may claim to be a real representation of underlying “real-world” values, they are, in fact, inter-referential within their own economy of meaning. So, for instance, a share in British Petroleum (BP) ostensibly represents a given fraction of the underlying assets and productive capacity of BP. But, in reality, the price of that share will also (perhaps predominantly) depend on what potential investors imagine the future of BP might be. It will depend on the geopolitics of oil and of the probability of environmental regulations or political instability. More generally, it will depend on the fluctuations of markets more broadly. (p.22)

It goes on to say that financial assets can never be said to refer to real-world values in an accurate and unproblematic way. Similar to how [pre-tax income](/posts/fragments-15) is an imaginary concept (since it assumes the absence of the conditions required for income to be made), measuring someone's net worth in terms of the value of the shares they own is also imaginary.

That's not to say that it bears _no_ resemblance to reality; the resemblance is just very indirect, very nebulous. And it gets more hazy as the net worth increases. Imagine if Jeff Bezos were to liquidate all his shares tomorrow, for whatever reason (religious epiphany, say). The price would drop like a rock. He would not be able to sell all 79 million shares at the current buying price of $1,600 a share - where would the buyers come from? And why would they choose to buy shares of a company whose CEO had just decided to abandon it?

So net worth is more like an asymptote than a real figure. An analogy to the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)) in physics is useful - trying to accurately calculate the net worth would require actually selling all that stock, which would itself have the effect of changing the value you are measuring.

I mean, we all kind of _know_ this - it's fairly intuitive - but it's a useful thing to remember now and then. We behave as if these numbers have meaning (think empty  rituals like Forbes' billionaire rankings) but they only have meaning in a semiotic sense. Like all money, really, but when it's in the form of stock market wealth, its virtuality is even more apparent. And once you see the virtuality of this wealth in our increasingly financialised economy, it becomes harder to accept. You start to question the legitimacy of the stock market, and the way it enables some imaginary numbers to be created out of thin air by corporate fiat which then end up having very real effects on the world. Finance may be a fiction, as Max Haiven argues in his book, but that doesn't mean it's not _real_:

> fictions can be among the most powerful forces in human societies. Indeed, it is through shared fictions that we reproduce social and subjective life itself.

And the fiction of the stock market has created the world's richest couple, seemingly out of nowhere. The structural violence that produced their wealth - through the actual work of their underpaid, overworked, and forgotten employees - is occluded, made irrelevant through the magic of financial instruments.

I'll leave you with a graphic I made for this post, which you may have seen in the social media previews. Any resemblance to actual corporate branding, living or dead, is purely coincidental.
