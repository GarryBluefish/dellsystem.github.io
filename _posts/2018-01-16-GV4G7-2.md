### Lecture

I missed this one, sadly. The seminar was great though.

### Seminar

* on why the wage is set by the minimum amount of socially necessary labour time
	* me: it's a minimum in an evolutionary sense cus otherwise the worker just wouldn't survive lol
	* and it's a maximum (at least thereotically) cus otherwise they'll be undercut by competition
	* it's really just a specific application of the principle of the LTV
	* recall that marx doesnt really give empirical proof, it's very analytic reasoning only
	* doesnt really apply anymore cus workers can control more than just labour power, like personal networks
		* it holds more under the conditions when marx was writing (industrial capitalism) but not as generally with rise of cogitive capitalism
		* only really works if the worker has nothing to sell other than their labour power
		* lucia says it doesnt work anyway cus commodities cannot be calculated in terms of socially necessary labour time
* on the statement that the worker "is _compelled_ to sell himself _of his own free will_" (from Capital v1)
	* me: kind of ironic, links to what Marx says about double freedom: contrast with feudalism where worker is not free to sell their own labour, but they're also free from means of production
		* formal freedom (legal regime of being able to sell own labour-power) and substantive one of being free of the means of production
		* also adorno & other critical theorists build on this point: workers are willing slaves etc
		* we can read this sentence as if the apparent paradox is a literary device meant to point out the contradiction/paradox in society itself: it's a false and illusory freedom
	* also, individual freedom but not collective freedom, collectively proletariat all have to sell their labour in general, even if some individuals may have more leeway
* on exploitation and force:
	* me: enclosure of the commons, between equal rights force prevails, social and psychological force as well (forcing working class people to work)
	* also the bourgeoisie is forced to keep investing in production as well, structural explanation, it's not just force on the proletariat but also a structural force ensuring that bourgoisie are trapped in this cycle of competition as well
	* reserve army of labour also forces people to accept low ages (structural limit)
* John Roemer's view of exploitation: it's a matter of unequal change of labour for goods (distributional inequality)
	* could be useful cus it makes it easier to measure quantitatively prevent ppl from moving the goalpost
	* but otoh it takes away the moral judgment, makes it less obvious that exploitation is a bad thing, like inequality is a natural and inevitable and acceptable outcome
	* me: if you remove the moral judgement and reduce it to a matter distributive of justice, to inequality, it feels more defensible, because it's easy to reify inequality it and see it as natural (think Mankiw) SO I DISAGREE. the distributive approach takes exploitation to be a neutral, descriptive, scientific term, so the moral burden shifts
	* another view: that the crux of exploitation is the lack of freedom, that's the objectionable part; Roemer ignores that aspect
	* another thing to keep in mind: marx is responding to smithian thought experiments of the lonely fisherman etc, which are completely removed from historical economic structures; that's kinda what roemer is going back on
	* someone mentioned that workers start living for their vacations as opposed for the work itself (not an exact quote I assume, seems more associated with the Situationists than Marx himself)
	* also Marx idealised the ability to be free from structural forces that would shove you into a labour category ([this quote](http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/note/2677)
	* basically marx himself is ambiguous on the issue of exploitation
		* it can seen as a directly moral issue or as a distributive issue
		* so the literature splits into two camps mostly
		* you need a structuralist view to have a moral aspect
		* whereas if you take the moral elements away you end up with an individualist view, focused on individual one-to-one relations
