For context: Kylie Jenner is the world's youngest "self-made" billionaire, having founded an eponymous cosmetics company whose products are little better than snake oil and whose profits come entirely from her astronomical social media celebrity, which celebrity she attained due to being related to other celebrities. You may also remember her from the controversy over the disastrous [Fyre Festival](/posts/fragments-26), when she made a [quarter of a million dollars](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a27028770/kendall-jenner-fyre-festival-responds/) for making one (now deleted) Instagram post announcing the festival.

More context: there are no self-made billionaires. Nobody "earns" a billion dollars all by their lonesome, and certainly nobody deserves to have a billion dollars to their name in our current economic climate.

Here's the latest Kylie Jenner controversy in a nutshell: today, she announced one product in her upcoming skincare, a walnut scrub meant as an exfoliant. Now, walnut shell is apparently extremely controversial as a facial exfoliant, and much of the [social media backlash](https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/kylie-jenner-skincare-kylie-skin-walnut-scrub) centres around the claim that it's actively bad for your face. There's also a fair amount of incredulity of the idea of this billionaire (who has access to the best facial care money can buy, and whose entire job is basically to look pretty for the camera) pretending that some snake oil product is the secret to her own skincare routine. 

Leaving aside the actual chemical issues here (I don't know anything about the walnut scrub, but I'm inclined to side with the people who say [it's bad for you](https://mashable.com/article/kylie-jenner-walnut-scrub-controversy/)), I think there's something telling about this whole episode, giving us a glimpse behind the curtain of the worldwide racket that is influencer marketing. It's a perfect blend of so many factors: the chillingly empty aesthetic, the overpriced product, the carefully-written script which instills a desire to buy while promising nothing in particular. The product rollout [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY-qyoDq9f0) features a dead-eyed Jenner, clad entirely in pink and against a backdrop of other things that are also pink, who holds a pink tube and says (in a flat, lifeless, "I'm just doing this for the money" voice), "My walnut face scrub is my secret to a fresh face."

Right, and smartwater has an [authentic role](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/press-releases/smartwater--and-jennifer-aniston-keep-moving-forward-in-new-adve) in Jennifer Aniston's role, and Nespresso's [commitment to sustainability](https://www.nestle-nespresso.com/newsandfeatures/George-Clooney-becomes-Nespresso-global-brand-ambassador-by-extending-his-relationship-with-the-brand-in-North-America) is why George Clooney is their brand ambassador.

I know I rail on advertising a lot, especially the influencer marketing variant, but to me it's indicative of many things that are wrong in our world today. It's bad for consumers - an attempt to deepen what is already a severe information asymmetry in favour of corporations - and it's bad for society as a whole, because it amounts to a further subsidy of the lifestyles of the rich and famous. And where does that subsidy come from? Well, it's built into the prices of the goods that are ultimately being sold, prices which are then justified through ad campaigns.

But wait, you might ask, what about the influencers themselves? Surely they're workers who should be compensated for their labour? No. Not all workers are the same, and not all workers should be supported as workers. They are beneficiaries of an inefficient arm of capital whose primary goal is to artifically stimulate demand for commodities that, let's remember, may actually be bad for you. Whatever compensation they make from recommending products (often made by workers who are poorly treated and terribly paid) is just a kickback from the ill-begotten profits gained through inflated prices and squeezed labour costs. Ultimately, their time is being directed toward socially unwelcome endeavours in a manner similar to the private health insurance industry in the US: single-payer healthcare might destroy that industry, and thereby the jobs of many workers, but maybe those jobs were never worth doing to be begin with.

The problem that influencer marketing purports to solve is that of information asymmetry: we don't know what products are good. But adding influencers to the mix doesn't actually solve this, it just makes it worse. As long as people are paid to promote products, there will be people paid to promote products they don't actually endorse, or haven't fully vetted. Why would anyone think otherwise? Does anyone actually believe that celebrities only take brand endorsements when they genuinely love the product? The whole point of the massive amounts of money in influencer marketing (including celebrity endorsements) is to get people to shill for products they wouldn't have shilled for organically. That's the whole logic here: tons of money, in order to buy integrity.

Imagine if advertising were transparently framed, the way tobacco sales in many countries are heavily regulated (and individual packs often decorated with gruesome images and medical warnings). The labels would have to be honest: this celebrity got paid $5 million for this advertising campaign, and he has only started using our product after we announced him as a brand ambassador. Kylie Jenner got paid $250,000 for this substance-free Instagram post about our equally substance-free festival; she will not be in attendance, nor does she know anything about the obviously inadequate planning for the festival. Etc, etc.

Of course, that can't really be enforced, and it might not even be that successful (people still smoke cigarettes, after all). To actually abolish influencer marketing, you'd need to address the root of the problem: tons of money being spent on marketing as the result of the widening gap between cost of goods sold and the prices people are willing to pay (especially for luxury goods). The problem is the overallocation of corporate resources in the pursuit of endless growth - never mind the negative ecological externalities - rather than investing in more sustainable consumption. We can try to regulate influencer marketing all we like (and we should!) but it will stay with us until we ditch our economic system that overproduces unnecessary commodities simply because someone finds it profitable.

Capitalism thrives by selling us a dream: if we buy this and this and this and this, we will be as happy and glamorous as the celebrities featured in ads. But the world will drown and choke and burn before we buy enough for that dream will come true. Time to wake up and smell the walnut scrub.
