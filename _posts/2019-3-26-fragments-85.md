I don't really have much to say on this other than what's already in the Bloomberg story: [McDonald's $300 Million Tech Deal Is Its Largest in 20 Years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-25/mcdonald-s-300-million-tech-deal-is-its-largest-in-20-years)

> McDonald’s Corp., in its largest acquisition in 20 years, is buying a decision-logic technology company to better personalize menus in its digital push.

> [...] With the new technology, McDonald’s restaurants can vary their electronic menu boards’ display of items, depending on factors such as the weather -- more coffee on cold days and McFlurries on hot days, for example -- and the time of day or regional preferences. The menus will also suggest add-on items to customers.

And you know, I'm sure someone ran the numbers and figured out that this startup's technology would, over a long enough time period, generate enough of a lift in sales to actually merit this $300m+ price tag. I'm not saying that it's an irrational purchase; I'm saying that it could be both perfectly rational and a horrific allocation of money and resources on a societal level, because "helping McDonalds sell more sugary crap" should not be worth $300m of society's collective attention. We live in hell.
