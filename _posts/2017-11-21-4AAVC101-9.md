### Reading

#### [The Sharing Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27310516-the-sharing-economy) by Arun Sundararajan (chapter 2)

Haven't been able to get my hands on a copy of this yet. Going to try to read it for my dissertation, though.

#### [What's Yours Is Mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26220875-what-s-yours-is-mine?ac=1&from_search=true) by Tom Slee (chapter 4)

Same.

### Lecture

* mostly uber and uber, plus a bunch of others (Lyft, Gett, TaskRabbit, HomeJoy is mentioned even though it's shut down now)
* AirPNP for renting out toilets which should be a public service >_>
* at least in priciple, acc to their own values, it's about empowering individuals
  * on a peer-to-peer exchange level
  * allowing a more sustainable/efficient use of resources
* the term "sharing economy" itself is fairly vacuous, seems to be more of a self-moniker than anything else
  * not actually about sharing (freely) since it's built on commercial transactions
  * the gig economy isn't the best term either since there are many firms (not in this space) that also rely on "gigs"
  * better characterisation: use of platform technology (multi-sided marketplace)
  * these companies also tend to be _lean_ (at least for now)
    * though Uber now owns more cars (links) and Airbnb is considering branding hotels
  * thus the best way of thinking of the sharing economy: "lean platforms"
* economic history starting from the 1970s, three major crises
  * profitability of Anglo firms, primarily due to competition from the rising manufacturing powerhouses in Japan/Germany
  * OPEC oil crisis, as a result of the Yom Kippur war in 1973; oil prices quadrupled in a few months
  * Bretton Woods falling apart, mostly because the US fucked up (partly due to budgetary pressures from Vietnam War)
* first factor: corporations' response: blame the unions (thus began their downfall)
  * wages started to stagnate, jobs increasingly outsourced to lower pay further (at least for tradeable goods)
  * otoh, non-tradeable goods were not outsourced
  * during 90s, technology allows companies to outsource impersonal services, using a lean/just-in-time model (using disposable workers)
    * which, of course, applies equally well to the lean platforms of today---they're just continuing this trend
* second factor: now, of course, the financial crisis
  * no (or few) mentions of the "sharing economy" until afterwards---recall Uber founded 2009, Deliveroo 2013
    * some older ones founded earlier (like Seamless, etc) but didn't really take off until after
  * unemployment doubled in the span of about 2 years in the US from 2008-2009, thus creating a pool of people desperate to take any job
  * stats on workforce composition: typically highly educated (70% of TaskRabbit workers have bachelors, 5% have PhDs)
* third factor: central banks slashing interest rates, hence people looking for riskier investments for higher returns
  * plus ofc the role of QE in creating all this excess capital in the first place
  * since 2009, so much VC sloshing around (not just established VC firms but also tech giants)
    * e.g., not just established VC firms but also tech giants' venture arms
    * though I would argue that in the last case, it's less about getting a return and more about getting in early in case it turns out to be a competitor/acquisition
* the state of the sharing economy today
  * firms are huge, huge valuations and revenues (even if not profitable)
    * smaller companies are dying or consolidating, think Grubhub/Seamless merging, or IKEA buying TaskRabbit
  * becoming increasingly commercial places, facilitating corporation revenues instead of "individual entrepeneurs"
    * Tom Slee, researching airbnb listings in NYC
      * 13% of listings take up 43% of all visits (how did he get this number??)
      * 60% of rentals are for entire homes (which could still be individuals, but also likely to be managed rentals)
    * NY attorney general report: 38% of revenues from properties rented out more than half the year---commercialised rentals, against state regulations
  * exploitation of workers, due to "independent contractor"/1099 status
  * reputation systems as a mechanism for disciplining workers/providers, as an alternative to actually training employees (which is not allowed for contractors)
    * obviously these reputation systems are affected by societal biases, which can affect livelihoods
* what now? will the sharing economy still be around 5 years from now
  * his theory: it will vanish
  * low profit margins, which is okay if services are used frequently enough (ridesharing, maybe food delivery) but what if that goes down
  * also relies on cheap labour force
    * in the case of AMT, this workforce can be global, and so that's harder to solve
    * but in the case of face-to-face services, like ridesharing/delivery/cleaning, you rely on a local excess of workers (which isn't necessarily here to stay, esp with employment regulation changes)
  * infrequent services, CAC/CLV ratio bad (esp in a saturated field where lots of competitors means you have to spend tons on marketing)
  * if the company's cut is too high, and the tech isn't that special, employees may decide that they can make more money off-platform (like HomeJoy which died for basically this reason)
  * growth-before-profits model
    * Uber losing so much money, partly to try to defeat Didi Chuxing in China (which failed), partly to defeat competitors & establish market hegemony
  * this era of cheap money may be coming to an end
    * central banks are starting to raise interest rates (find date/link), though srnicek thinks it was a bit premature
    * so the bubble in VC may be starting to deflate
    * which could spell the end of Uber's growth-before-profits model because that relies on finding more funding to fuel growth
    * you can see this in tech startups cutting back on their stupid workplace perks (link) or even doing layoffs (Twitter, link)
  * regulators starting to catch up
    * airbnb: links to shutting down in paris, etc
    * uber: temporarily banned in london (as a negotiating tactic most likely), impinging on profitability
  * workers also responding to their exploitation: organising (unions-link to callum's post), workers compensation lawsuits
    * link to uber $100mil settlement + other lawsuits (uber admitted $429m), lyft ($20m), postmates ($800m)
    * but ofc paying workers minimum wage doesn't work with their assetless balance sheet strategy or business model in general
* student Q about uber trying to do advertising in-ride
  * srnicek thinks they can't adapt to that quickly enough cus they dont have the data, they'd have to partner with someone else but then their margins are not enough
* student Q: do you think Uber and TFL could merge in the long-run
  * srnicek: TFL should incorporate these apps into theirs, so they could regulate them better
