_Yesterday's post was about 2,000 words longer than I'd originally planned, so today's post is just a compendium of other people's responses to a [viral tweet](https://twitter.com/Jakeandbake336/status/1130434779248300032) which claims that "minimum wage is livable if you cut out entertainment, alcohol, drug, and eating out costs"._

Sorry for the Buzzfeed-style post today. Conclusion: minimum wage is livable if you reduce your expectations to the bare minimum for survival, and if you're able to continually lower your expectations as necessary to maintain corporate profit margins - if you consent to be nothing more than a blank vessel for the circuit of capital accumulation. Nice of the OP to make this argument so plain.
