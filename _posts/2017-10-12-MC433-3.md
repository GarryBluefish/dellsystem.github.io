### Readings

#### [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72657.Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed) by Paulo Freire (chapter 1)

Published in 1970 in English (originally published in Portuguese 2 years earlier). This is a lovely & quite philosophical work that draws heavily on critical theory, though its practicality may be limited (and it may be used as a way of shifting the burden away from the oppressor and onto the oppressed). I have some rough notes below, but if you're into Hegel or Lukács or just beautiful prose, you might as well read the original.

* the oppressed cannot (should not) oppress their oppressors
* their only option is to _liberate_, both themselves and their oppressors
* only the oppressed are capable of doing this---only they can be the revolutionary subject
* if the oppressors are ever generous, it's on the back of an unjust social order
* there's a natural tendency for the oppressed to, eventually, become sub-oppressors in turn
  * the reason: their whole image of humanity is defined by the image of the oppressor
  * selfhood inextricably shaped by their concrete existential situation
  * e.g., worker who becomes a manager then tends to oppress other workers (because it's the most prominent social relation they've known)
  * the shadow of the former oppressor is cast over them still and they cannot escape
* duality of the oppressed: they are both themselves + the internalised consciousness of their oppressor
  * here he cites Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit ("Mind" in the book's translation) & his master-slave dialectic
* incidentally, I thought it was funny that Lukács' book on Lenin was cited via its French translation, when it was originally published in German (maybe Freire could read French but not German)
* "the oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for redemption"
  * the oppressed themselves must develop a pedagogy---it cannot simply be handed to them by their oppressor
* we need a _humanist_, not a _humanitarian_, approach---without humanist sentiment, humanitarianism becomes dehumanising
* the oppressed are not capable of initiating violence
  * their very existence as the oppressed, and the prior subjugation that entails, is itself violence
* only the oppressed can free their oppressors by taking away their power to oppress & therefore returning their humanity to them
* we can't just broadcast propaganda to the oppressed; they must enter the struggles as fully empowered humans, whatever that means in practice

#### [MacBride report](http://www.un-documents.net/macbride-report.pdf) (pages V-1-18)

A UNESCO publication entitled "Many Voices One World" from 1981. A fairly radical take on the key role of communication in the world, and how we need national media/education/etc to try to alleviate the effects of the market. Moving away from the right to free speech and toward the right to _communicate_.

### Lecture

* today: looking at the power of law (as enforced by the state) to regulate technology (as opposed to markets, which we looked at last week)
* tension between the right to free speech & having an orderly society
* in the postwar context (decolonisation, post-Holocaust, etc), ideas on communication starting to shift
  * right to communicate starting to supplant the idea of right to information
  * burgeoning satellite communications industry, which is being carved out in a very inegalitarian, first-come first-served way (mostly by US)
  * shifting away from a one-way, free-speech centered model to a bidirectional, discourse-driven one (monologic -> dialogic)
* Non-Aligned Movement during Cold War, which consisted of countries that explicitly did not want to take sides
  * challenging US domination & imperialism
  * founded in 1956 with India, Indonesia, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Ghana
  * one goal was to reorganise existing communication channels (which were often a legacy of a colonial past)
  * they introduced a resolution at UNESCO to move away from monologic order and toward a dialogic one (at the time, UNESCO was a fairly authoritarian institution for technology/knowledge transfer)
    * in order to establish & maintain a new economic order, we need to also establish a new information order, one based on communication
    * need to address lack of respect for Third World countries
    * concern about information news flows & monopoly power of some existing communication agencies
    * noted an unequal distribution of communication ability around the world
  * as a result, UNESCO established the MacBride Commission, which authored the MacBride report from the readings
    * main goal of the report: to set norms for state policy in influencing the media
    * very different from the self-regulating, American-exceptionalism approach of the Hutchins report
    * criticised the supposed "right of free speech", elevated alternative rights
    * end goal is to make Third World countries self-reliant & recognised as truly independent
    * recommended better quality international news, partly through better conditions for journalists
    * saw communication rights as a prerequisite for human rights
    * to be achieved through a state-regulated paradigm, NOT a laissez-faire one
    * incidentally, the aftermath of this report was that the US soon pulled out of UNESCO (in 1984) and only rejoined in 2002, and ofc now we know UNESCO as a very different body---UNESCO's mission was thus transformed from establishing communications policy to, what, designating World Heritage sites?
* now onto the pedagogy (Freire) approach
  * roughly contemporaneous w/ MacBride report, but very different in terms of its approach
  * it's naive to expect the dominant classes to develop education to transform the oppressed
  * the pedagogy must be immanent, must come from within---you need a critical & liberating dialogue
  * contrast/compare with Fraser's idea of a counter public sphere?
  * but ofc this approach doesn't talk about the state at all---it's focused on norms (**self**-development)

### Seminar

* interesting tension: the possibility that the MacBride report used anti-American sentiment as a sort of cover for justifying state-run monopolies
* on Freire's pedagogical approach:
  * putting all the responsibility/burden on the oppressed
  * definitely more on the abstract rather than the realistic side
  * kind of paternalistic in some ways
  * my worry with his sub-oppression thing (which I find compelling on a philosophical level) is that it sort of feeds into this whole "reverse discrimination" narrative that's been, unfortunately, dominating the airwaves lately
  * he never really defines "oppressed" or gives examples (beyond worker/manager I guess), probably with the intention of making his text universally applicable
* linking this to last week's seminar on Southern press & the "false generosity" of the white Southern editors---in that case, the burden of responsibility being on the oppressed may not necessarily be a bad thing
* comparing with Fraser:
  * for Freire, there's a moment when the oppression stops, and the oppressed can begin to build a pedagogy in peace
  * Fraser's approach is more realistic, recognises the real barriers that the oppressed can face in public spheres
  * Freire focuses on a much smaller piece and thus abstracts away such barriers
  * Q to think about: what does Freire's theory imply for the right to communicate & the ideal role of the state?
