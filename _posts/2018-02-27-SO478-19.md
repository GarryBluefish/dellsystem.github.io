### Lecture

VoC, focus on advanced economies

* northern european economies much more organised for stronger labour and more coordination (going back a long way)
* just a thought: he doesnt really question skill-based allocation? kinda just takes it for granted, never critical
* he's acknowledging that democracy hasnt been increasing redistribution
	* in fordism, labour market produced egalitarian outcomes
	* in knowledge economy less egalitarian, bifurcation
	* so just as political system becomes more crucial for providing equality, it has become less capable
* soskice says that one reason for this:
	* people losing out the most not a majority
	* i dont really agree with this, i think we have to look at problems with the implementation of electoral systems literally everywhere
* interesting that immigrant populist backlash tends to be along nationnal lines: why??

### Seminar

(my bit, explaining the rise of far-right populism)

* here i'm building on work by dani rodrik and by nancy fraser
* in a word, i would say the answer is neoliberalism. in two different senses
	* neoliberal policy over the last four decades
		* specifically, favouring capital over labour, resulting in increased inequality and worsening conditions for many at the bottom
		* combined with concurrent technological development and opening up the flow of goods through globalisation
		* low union density
	* at the same time, there's been this shift in the political landscape which i would call the failure of centrist politics
		* where the traditionally left parties have moved towards the centre
		* most significantly in the US with the Democratic Party (which was never very left-wing to begin with, tbh)
		* but here in the UK as well, despite the Labour party's grounding in the labour movement
		* during the Blair years and even more in the Brown years of New Labour
		* the result was that these left parties gave up ground on economic issues
		* failed to challenge neoliberal policy, completely bought into the idea that there is no alternative
		* and so if they couldnt really compete on economic issues with the right, they ended up differing on cultural issues
		* i would say this is worse in the US than in the UK, and maybe that's why 
		* basically the democratic party offered so little
		* esp with clinton: classic liberal offer of everything is mostly fine just need to be nicer
	* distinguish from left-wing populism, which is what we've seen in latin america (rodrik)
* branko milanovic inequality possibility frontier
	* as more is produced due to technological development
	* industrial revolution -> can produce so much more thus inequality goes up (since more is possible)
