I've been pretty busy this week, with classes resuming for fall semester and a major project that I'm wrapping up. This week, I made some improvements to the code explore page and started on the file upload functionality for singles and bundles (tentatively known collectively as "modules", although this is subject to change), but haven't had a chance to commit the changes yet. I will work on finishing what I planned to do in [last week's update](/posts/agora-octave-update-4) in the next couple of days, and will commit the changes and post a more comprehensive update (update 5.1?) by the end of the weekend. I'll also update the demo and will help to update [agora.octave.org](http://agora.octave.org) to the new codebase.

## Position in timeline

* _**August 1-15:** Check out codebase, get it running; read all the code and documentation; start learning Mercurial_
* _**August 16-31:** Start working on design; start mocking up models and routes for the components_
* **September 1 - October 15: Work on the core components, with as much test coverage and documentation as is feasible; start implementing the views, models and templates**
* _**October 16-31:** Ensure that documentation is thorough and up to date; write any remaining tests that need to be written; test out the user interface and fix any bugs_
