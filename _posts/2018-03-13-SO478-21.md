### Lecture

Laura Bear of the anthropology dept

* some of the readings are from two parallel worlds, juxtapose claims of powerful orgs (public-private partnerships) vs what actually happens (acc to activists etc)
* what is the global new public good?
	* seen as politically neutral (not left or right) instead technocratic best practice (should link to andy merrifield's book The Amateur)
	* changes in public debt regimes, treated as if it's regular financial debt (lined to markets by sovereign debt bonds)
	* public good reduced to the idea of effiicency by a very narrow measure (not inequality but instead financial/quantitative targets)
* results in entrepreneurial/flexible state where bureaucrats have ambiguous power
	* speculative state, amplifying effects of volatile markets
	* accumulation by dispossesion by private sector from public resources
		* public private partnerships (PFI ex)
		* also guaranteeing of profits by taxpayers (privatise gains socialise losses)
* this global "new public good" seen in IFI debt regimes in global south + austerity in global north
* the old public good: political relation, socialist state
	* debts treated as political, for collective long-term investment in future
	* funded by one-off loans from banks to state (fixed low rates) or central bank, repaid by taxpayer
	* based around central planing (5-year + plans)
* in the new public good, neoliberal ideology propagated by IMF and WB
	* if state is holding onto a large amount of capital then it's seen as fundamentally unproductive
	* state starvation thesis (assuming markets are efficient)
	* central bank independence, commercial bank expansion
	* sovereign debt bonds, financial market trading in derivatives
	* public-private partnerships
	* so taxpayers subsiding financial firms + PPP firms
* shifting to a model where citizen is seen as a consumer, purpose of govt is to provide value in terms of cost-benefit
	* third-world politics, based on idea that old forms of govt were fundamentally corupt in third world
* result of this new model (from anthro perspctive): precarious citizenship, democratic deficit
* financial debt regimes change the state
	* normativity of numbers in goals and targets (the specific kinds collected are problematic)
* results in brokerage and acccumulation from public sector
	* flexible bureaucracy more responsive to citizens needs + entrepreneurial governance more suited to creation of growth in markets
	* which really just results in new kinds of brokers, NGOs and management consultancies
	* also reduced transparency: complex structure, regulations, secrecy
	* hidden accumulation from public resources
	* dispossesion of citizens rights and taxpayesr resources
	* speculative planning: bureaucrats given leeway to attract investors/entrepeneurs in the short term (behind the scenes negotations)
* democratic deficit
	* national institutions captured by global IFIs and markets
	* bureaucracies guided by audit practices
	* commons of public sectors enclosed
* alternatives
	* sovereign debt jubilee along with dissolving IMF/WB (which i can get behind tbh)
	* new forms of government financing w/o marketisation
	* challenge technocratic model of central banking
	* social movements to challenge status quo politics
	* other things in this vein
* arguing against technocratic form of power that is quite recent

### seminar

* ultimately it's accountability that is of concern, not necessary the professionalisation aspect (obviously)
* like lack of institutions and professionalism isnt necessary a good thing ...
* me on higher education TEF marketisation, sometimes you need industrial action to reverse direction
