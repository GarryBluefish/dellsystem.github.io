    I'm not actually registered for this module, but the lecturer is the author
    of a wonderful <a
    href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25734110-in-defense-of-housing'>Verso
    book on housing</a> on my to-read shelf, so I'm planning to drop in on the
    lectures when I can.

    Now, I'm not actually a student at King's, but their security is a lot less
    strict than LSE's is, so I've just been surreptitiously auditing the
    lectures by casually following the other students into the classroom.
    The lecturer, Nick Srnicek, is the
    author of two excellent books at the intersection of technology and leftist
    politics: <a
    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25387807-inventing-the-future">Inventing
    the Future (with Alex Williams)</a>, and <a
    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32999998-platform-capitalism">Platform
    Capitalism</a>.
    {% else %}
    I'm taking this module as part of the one-year Inequalities and Social
    Science MSc program.
