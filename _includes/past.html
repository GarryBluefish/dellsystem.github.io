<p>I used to occasionally give tech talks - some pedagogical, some extolling the virtues of my (now defunct) startup. I haven't done a good job of keeping track of these, but you can view some of my slides on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dellsystem">Speakerdeck</a> (source on <a href="https://github.com/dellsystem/slides">GitHub</a>).</p>
