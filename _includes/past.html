	<li><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerbyTransformed/">Derby Transformed</a> (Sep 1, 2018)</strong>: I spoke on two panels, one on media reform and one on Corbynomics. I have recordings of both, which I may post or transcribe at some point.</li>
	<li><strong>Byline Festival (Aug 25, 2018)</strong>: An odd panel titled <a href="https://www.bylinefestival.com/datadome18/2018/8/25/digital-dominance-and-digital-rights">Digital Dominance and Digital Rights</a>, where I spoke alongside a fairly baffling mix of people, most of whom are much more famous than I. Might write something about this later.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/250006089151660/">Logic Issue 5: "Failure" Launch</a> (Aug 21, 2018)</strong>: I read an excerpt from <a href="https://logicmag.io/05-freedom-isnt-free/">Freedom Isn't Free</a>.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/244485083041915/">Tech Workers Coalition event on contractor organising</a> (Aug 8, 2018)</strong>: I moderated this incredibly informative roundtable discussion on temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs) in Silicon Valley. Notes coming, hopefully.</li>
	<li><strong>Labour Live (Jun 16, 2018)</strong>: I spoke on a panel about tech/automation/etc, alongside Nick Srnicek, Aaron Bastani and Lara McNeill (chair). No notes, sadly.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>David Foster Wallace Conference (Jun 7-9, 2018)</strong>: I spoke on a panel about diversity in the DFW community. I don't have any notes, but the panel was written about for <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/5543/david-foster-wallace-conference-profile">The Outline</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Left Forum (Jun 1-3, 2018)</strong>: I organised two panels on tech workers, both of which have been transcribed: Towards an Organized Tech Industry, <a href="http://www.notesfrombelow.org/article/towards-an-organized-tech-industry-part-one">Part One</a> and <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/towards-an-organized-tech-industry-part-two">Part Two</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>John McDonnell's State of the Economy Conference (May 19, 2018)</strong>: I delivered <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/technological-development-for-the-many/">a talk</a> challenging the predominant narrative around technological development as part of the digital breakout session.

	<li><strong>New Internationalist Ethical Careers Fair (Apr 25, 2018)</strong>: I spoke on a panel titled "The Future of Work" alongside Jamie Woodcock, Will Stronge, and Yohann Koshy (chair). Notes unlikely at this point.</li>

<p>I used to occasionally give tech talks - some pedagogical, some extolling the virtues of my (now defunct) startup. I haven't done a good job of keeping track of these, but you can view some of my slides on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dellsystem">Speakerdeck</a> (source on <a href="https://github.com/dellsystem/slides">GitHub</a>).</p>
