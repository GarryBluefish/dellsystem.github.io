title: "Critical perspectives on technology: resources"
---

*Last updated: May 7, 2018.*

A wide-ranging list of resources for those interested in a more critical understanding of the technology industry, grounded in a recognition of its economic, social and political context.

This was initially compiled as a companion to the March 2018 issue of [Notes From Below](https://notesfrombelow.org), called [Technology and The Worker](https://notesfrombelow.org/issue/technology-and-the-worker), which I co-curated. That issue contains some excellent pieces at the intersection of technology and class composition, most of which aren't listed here, and I would highly recommend taking a look.

There's a lot here, with resources in a variety of formats (books, articles, podcasts, communities, individuals), and I suggest you bookmark this page and use it as a reference if you're interested in this topic. If you think something should be added to this list, [get in touch](/about).

## Books

### First-person accounts

* **[Close to the Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/486625.Close_to_the_Machine) by Ellen Ullman.**
* **[The Boy Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13573517-the-boy-kings) by Kate Losse.** She was an early employee at Facebook and writes about her experiences there. Very beautifully written.
* **[Chaos Monkeys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28259132-chaos-monkeys) by Antonio García Martinez.** A guy who sold a company to Twitter and later worked at Facebook writes a fairly obnoxious tell-all in which excoriates everyone in the valley while bragging about his yacht. Worth reading for the insider account of working in the industry, but I found his criticism to be pretty toothless.
* **[Disrupted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26030703-disrupted) by Dan Lyons.** About his time at HubSpot. Also pretty obnoxious, sadly.
* **[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20657434-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things) by Ben Horowitz**. Ben Horowitz is now a name partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and I guess this book is meant to justify his present amount of wealth and power by showing us all the "hard things" he went through to get to where he is now.
	* John Patrick Leary has written a good critique of it for The New Inquiry: [The Poverty of Entrepreneurship: The Silicon Valley Theory of History](https://thenewinquiry.com/the-poverty-of-entrepreneurship-the-silicon-valley-theory-of-history/)
* **[Live Work Work Work Die](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35684687-live-work-work-work-die) by Corey Pein**. Really looking to reading this.
	* [Excerpt at NYMag](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/corey-pein-live-work-work-work-die-excerpt-on-web-fraud.html)
	* [Episode of The Discourse podcast featuring Corey Pein as a guest](https://twitter.com/Th3Discourse/status/988539488430428160)
	* [Review for Salon by Keith Spencer](https://www.salon.com/2018/04/22/live-work-work-work-die-paints-a-portrait-of-silicon-valleys-dark-heart/)
	* [Review for The New Republic by Shuja Haider](https://newrepublic.com/article/148217/silicon-valleys-rigged-game-life)
		* "Like The Turk, Silicon Valley is an impressive automaton hiding a con job. Beneath its carefully constructed appearance of meritocracy are the world’s most powerful people, pulling strings, turning gears, and winning every time."

### Third-person accounts

* **[Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk) by Ashlee Vance.** A little too bright-eyed. Good counterweights below:
	* Paris Marx for Jacobin: [Elon Musk is Not the Future](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/02/elon-musk-hyperloop-public-transit-tech)
	* Hamilton Nolan for Splinter: [Elon Musk Is an Asshole](https://splinternews.com/elon-musk-is-an-asshole-1824204789#_ga=2.204781072.1416667281.1522423508-943536000.1518691760) (short and to the point)
	* Jemima Kelly for the Financial Times' Alphaville (of all places!): [The world doesn't need more Elon Musks](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/04/17/1523937600000/The-world-doesn-t-need-more-Elon-Musks/)
* **[Hatching Twitter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18656827-hatching-twitter) by Nick Bilton.** Chronicles the early days of Twitter. Really well-written.

### The economics of the industry

#### Critical takes

* **[Digital Labour and Karl Marx](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17939361-digital-labour-and-karl-marx) by Christian Fuchs.** This was a weird read (more of a textbook, with a ton of introductory stuff on both topics crammed in) but has some good insights. Written by a media professor in a very dry, thoroughly academic style.
* **The Telekommunist Manifesto by Dmytri Kleiner ([available as a PDF](http://media.telekommunisten.net/manifesto.pdf))**. A Marxist take on the economics behind the tech industry. I haven't actually read this yet but I need to.
* **[Platform Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32999998-platform-capitalism) by Nick Srnicek.** A Marxist analysis of contemporary technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Airbnb, and Amazon. Quite groundbreaking, really. Highly recommended. And if you like this, I'd also recommend Srnicek's more popular book _Inventing the Future_, co-authored with Alex Williams, on the role of politics in directing technological change.
* **[Ours to Hack and to Own](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35613652-ours-to-hack-and-to-own) by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Schneider.** A good collection of essays on platform cooperatives and their potential role. Doesn't have that much to say about the wider economic context in which these co-ops would be situated, but still a good read.
* **[A Hacker Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369873.A_Hacker_Manifesto) by McKenzie Wark.** I honestly loved this book. It's from 2004, and doesn't really go into specifics about the industry itself, but it does a great job of placing the information industry in its historical economic context, while also firmly grounded in the critical theory tradition. Highly recommended.
* **[Cognitive Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14803576-cognitive-capitalism) by Yann Moulier-Boutang.** A critical perspective on the political economy of tech, which proposes that we are in the midst of transitioning to a new mode of capitalism. Aligns nicely with Wark's Hacker Manifesto, but this one is more detailed on the specific economic characteristics of our era.
* Not really a book, but Jacobin had an entire issue on technology called **[Ours To Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25162533-ours-to-master)**, which has some good stuff.
* **[The Black Box Society](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21878126-the-black-box-society) by Frank Pasquale.**
* **[Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction) by Cathy O'Neil.** Takes a deep dive into how inequality is algorithmically reinforced in various contexts.
* **[Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32904335-throwing-rocks-at-the-google-bus) by Douglas Rushkoff.** Haven't read this yet.

#### Less critical takes

* **[The Industries of the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111341-the-industries-of-the-future) by Alec J Ross**. Predictions on the future of the tech industry. It's actually somewhat critical but this is a guy who once worked for Hillary Clinton and who seems to mostly share her very neoliberal outlook on the world, so don't expect much.
* **[Who Owns The Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144098-who-owns-the-future) by Jaron Lanier**. This is also somewhat critical—he castigates large tech companies for having too much control over for lives. Still, I think his proposed solution (the "micropayments" thing) is highly misguided and betrays a complete misunderstanding (or ignorance) of the labour theory of value, so I'm putting it in this category.
* **[World Without Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34311003-world-without-mind) by Franklin Foer.** A journalist explains the dangers of Facebook and Google having a monopoly over our media sources. I agree with his concerns, but his solutions centre around better regulation, which imo is not enough to address the roots of the problem.
* **[The Wealth of Humans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663661-the-wealth-of-humans) by Ryan Avent**. An editor for the_Economist_ laments that technology (esp automation) is changing the relationship between capital and labour by reducing the value of labour. This had potential, but its fundamental outlook is very liberal, and doesn't do enough to question the economic landscape that led to technology being used in the way that is.
* **[WTF: what's the future and why it's up to us](https://wtfeconomy.com/wtf-whats-the-future-and-why-it-s-up-to-us-c56cbe3cea2b) by Tim O'Reilly.** I haven't actually read this yet, but from the [Medium post introducing the book](https://wtfeconomy.com/wtf-whats-the-future-and-why-it-s-up-to-us-c56cbe3cea2b), it sounds like he's saying that powerful corporations essentially need to behave better, rather than questioning the fact that these unaccountable for-profit corporations have been given so much power in the first place.

### Very uncritical takes

Read them to understand the enemy, esssentially.

* **[Zero to One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one) by Peter Thiel**. On why/how startups should strive to become monopolies
	* A very thoughtful review by Guy Patrick Cunningham for Los Angeles Review of Books: [Citizen Thiel](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/citizen-thiel)
* **[The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) by Eric Ries**. A guide to building a "lean" (agile, iterative, responsive, etc) tech startup.
* **[Hackers and Painters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41793.Hackers_Painters) by Paul Graham.** A bunch of essays that are mostly about how great Paul Graham is. An (unfortunately) semi-seminal work. You can find the essays for free on his website.
* **[The Cathedral & the Bazaar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134825.The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar) by Eric S. Raymond.** On open source. This actually isn't that bad, though the author has some really weird views these days (mostly when it comes to women).
* **[The Second Machine Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23316526-the-second-machine-age) by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.** A very techno-optimistic book that only ever pays attention to the mainstream economic narrative (completely ignoring any alternative, more heterodox narratives), which means mainstream economists love it.

	* "But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform."
	* "Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it."
	* "In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time."

### The economics of the tech industry

* Leif Weatherby for LARB: [Delete Your Account: On the Theory of Platform Capitalism](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/delete-your-account-on-the-theory-of-platform-capitalism/). A very impressive overview of several relevant books:
	* Benjamin Bratton's The Stack (I haven't finished this yet; super long)
	* Machine, Platform, Crowd by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson (haven't read this yet. Sounds like it's broadly accurate in describing trends, but its authors come from a particular normative perspective, as Weatherby writes: "Subtract the ghoulish enthusiasm, and this is one of the most compelling descriptions of the present I have found anywhere." Also: "Brynjolfsson and McAfee imagine a fully automated luxury communism for the very, very few.")
	* Nick Srnicek's Platform Capitalism (which is good, if incomplete)
	* Franklin Foer's World Without Mind (some good stuff but I disagree with a lot of his conclusions)
	* Scott Galloway's The Four (haven't read this yet)
