title: "Critical perspectives on technology: resources"
---

*Last updated: March 31, 2018.*

A wide-ranging list of resources for those interested in a more critical understanding of the technology industry, grounded in a recognition of its economic, social and political context.

This was initially compiled as a companion to the March 2018 issue of [Notes From Below](https://notesfrombelow.org), called [Technology and The Worker](/issue/tech), for which I was co-curator. That issue contains some excellent pieces at the intersection of technology and class composition, and I would highly recommend taking a look.

There's a lot here, with resources in a variety of formats (books, articles, podcasts, communities, individuals), and wI suggest you bookmark this page and use it as a reference if you're interested in this topic. If you think something should be added to this list, [get in touch](/about).

## Books

### First-person accounts

* **[Chaos Monkeys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28259132-chaos-monkeys) by Antonio García Martinez.** A guy who sold a company to Twitter and later worked at Facebook writes a fairly obnoxious tell-all in which excoriates everyone in the valley while bragging about his yacht. Worth reading for the insider account of working in the industry, but I found his criticism to be pretty toothless.
* **Disrupted by Dan Lyons**. About his time at HubSpot. Also pretty obnoxious, sadly.
* **The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz**. Ben Horowitz is now a name partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and I guess this book is meant to justify his present amount of wealth and power by showing us all the "hard things" he went through to get to where he is now.
	* John Patrick Leary has written a good critique of it for The New Inquiry: [The Poverty of Entrepreneurship: The Silicon Valley Theory of History](https://thenewinquiry.com/the-poverty-of-entrepreneurship-the-silicon-valley-theory-of-history/)

### The economics of the industry

#### Critical takes

* **Digital Labour and Karl Marx by Christian Fuchs**. This was a weird read (more of a textbook, with a ton of introductory stuff on both topics crammed in) but has some good insights. Written by a media professor in a very dry, thoroughly academic style.
* **The Telekommunist Manifesto by Dmytri Kleiner ([available as a PDF](http://media.telekommunisten.net/manifesto.pdf))**. A Marxist take on the economics behind the tech industry. I haven't actually read this yet but I need to.
* **Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek**. A Marxist analysis of contemporary technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Airbnb, and Amazon. Quite groundbreaking, really. Highly recommended. And if you like this, I'd also recommend Srnicek's more popular book _Inventing the Future_, co-authored with Alex Williams, on the role of politics in directing technological change.
* **Ours to Hack and to Own by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Schneider**. A good collection of essays on platform cooperatives and their potential role. Doesn't have that much to say about the wider economic context in which these co-ops would be situated, but still a good read.
* **A Hacker Manifesto by McKenzie Wark**. I honestly loved this book. It's from 2004, and doesn't really go into specifics about the industry itself, but it does a great job of placing the information industry in its historical economic context, while also firmly grounded in the critical theory tradition. Highly recommended.
* **Cognitive Capitalism by Yann Moulier-Boutang**. A critical perspective on the political economy of tech, which proposes that we are in the midst of transitioning to a new mode of capitalism. Aligns nicely with Wark's Hacker Manifesto, but this one is more detailed on the specific economic characteristics of our era.
* Not really a book, but Jacobin had an entire issue on technology called **[Ours To Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25162533-ours-to-master)**, which has some good stuff.

#### Less critical takes

* **Industries of the Future by Alec J Ross**. Predictions on the future of the tech industry. It's actually somewhat critical but this is a guy who once worked for Hillary Clinton and who seems to mostly share her very neoliberal outlook on the world, so don't expect much.
* **Who Owns The Future by Jaron Lanier**. This is also somewhat critical—he castigates large tech companies for having too much control over for lives. Still, I think his proposed solution (the "micropayments" thing) is highly misguided and betrays a complete misunderstanding (or ignorance) of the labour theory of value, so I'm putting it in this category.
* **World Without Mind by Franklin Foer**. A journalist explains the dangers of Facebook and Google having a monopoly over our media sources. I agree with his concerns, but his solutions centre around better regulation, which imo is not enough to address the roots of the problem.
* **The Wealth of Humans by Ryan Avent**. An editor for the_Economist_ laments that technology is changing the relationship between capital and labour by reducing the value of labour. This had potential, but its fundamental outlook is very liberal, and doesn't do enough to question the economic landscape that led to technology being used in the way that is.
* **The Second Machine Age by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee**. A very techno-optimistic book that only ever pays attention to the mainstream economic narrative (completely ignoring any alternative, more heterodox narratives), which means mainstream economists love it.
* **Zero to One by Peter Thiel**. On why/how startups should strive to become monopolies.
* **Lean Startup by Eric Ries**. A guide to building a tech startup.
