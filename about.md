I recently graduated from an undergraduate program at McGill University, with a
major in Math and Computer Science. I mostly write server-side Python these
days, but I started my programming journey with web development and design,
and I owe much of my current interest in computer science to the
[phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com) community, which welcomed me aboard as a
moderator when I was but a clueless 15-year-old who had only just learned what
Linux was.

Feel free to email me at me@\[this domain\] or send
me a message on Twitter [@dellsystem][twitter] if you want to get in touch.
