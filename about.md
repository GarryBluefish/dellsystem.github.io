I started building websites when I was 12, making heavy use of the popular
Copy and Paste Code From Other Websites method. My first few websites were
cheesy and terrible so I'll spare you the details, but one website was popular
enough that I found myself managing a small but vibrant community of users,
using the open source bulletin board software [phpBB](http://phpbb.com). As a
result, I spent a lot of time in the phpBB support forums, and eventually
picked up enough web dev knowledge to start answering other people's support
questions -- not always accurately, but it was a great way to learn.

I no longer run any phpBB boards, but I owe much of my current interest in
computer science to the that community, which welcomed me aboard as a
moderator -- and, later, as a member of the website team -- even though I was a
clueless 15-year-old who had only just found out what Linux was. My early
programming experiences consisted of modifying phpBB installations, which was
probably not the best way to learn PHP, but I persevered and eventually
discovered languages that are not PHP.

In 2014, I graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Science in
Mathematics and Computer Science. I still make cheesy and terrible websites on
occasion, like when I registered the domain howdoi.land to show a perpetually
flying martlet using CSS animations (still one of my proudest accomplishments).
My primary occupation these days, though, is building the core technology for
[Macromeasures], so I haven't animated any martlets in a while.
