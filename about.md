I'm a third-year student studying math and computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I'm interested in web development and design, particularly when it involves FOSS, phpBB, jQuery, Django, Liquid, Markdown, Inkscape, pretty icons or any combination of the above. I also like non-web things like network and graph theory, anything in the intersection of math and computer science, and really cool command-line scripts. Feel free to [email me](#contact-info) if you want to get in touch.
