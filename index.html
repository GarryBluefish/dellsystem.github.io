	<h2>I'm Wendy Liu, and I live in London.</h2>
	<h3>I write and speak about technology from a socialist perspective.</h3>
	<h4>Before I discovered the "left", I was a software engineer and startup founder (see "<a href="http://www.notesfrombelow.org/article/silicon-inquiry">Silicon Inquiry</a>").</h4>

		<h2>code</h2>
		<p>I've been coding for a while, mostly in the realm of web dev (primarily backed). See: my <a href="https://github.com/dellsystem">GitHub</a>, and <a href="/code">past projects</a>.</p>
		<p>I no longer do it as a job, but I do manage some websites for UK left projects in my spare time: <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk">New Socialist</a>, <a href="https://theworldtransformed.org/)">The World Transformed</a>, and <a href="https://www.notesfrombelow.org">Notes From Below</a>.</p>
		<p>I'm not taking on any more projects at this time, but I know people who are! Message me.</p>
