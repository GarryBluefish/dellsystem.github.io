title: "ABOLISH SILICON VALLEY, for Novara Media"
---

On July 2, 2018, I went on Novara Media's TyskySour show (which was livestreamed). We talked about stop-and-search, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory, and what it would mean to "abolish Silicon Valley", a semi-serious idea that I basically made up on Twitter the week before:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">since everyone&#39;s talking about abolition now, i&#39;d like to propose a campaign to abolish silicon valley</p>&mdash; Wendy Liu (@dellsystem) <a href="https://twitter.com/dellsystem/status/1011377301009895424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2018</a></blockquote>

The convo builds on a piece I wrote for Novara the previous week: [Now is the Time for Worker Power in the Tech Industry](http://novaramedia.com/2018/06/27/now-is-the-time-for-worker-power-in-the-tech-industry/). The full video is available here:

The first ~25 minutes mostly consist of Ash talking about stop-and-search, with a few comments from me on predictive policing near the end. The next ~25 minutes are on Ocasio-Cortez. The part after that is where I talk about building worker power in the tech industry and how that fits into a larger vision for abolishing Silicon Valley. (There was also some fairly heated debate over the merits of Huel.)

Some clips, if you don't want to watch the whole thing:

**Ash on stop and search:**

**Me on the failure of liberal politics to adequately respond to people's needs in this polarised era:**

**Me pointing out that most tech workers don't go into tech because they personally want to be part of the military-industrial complex, or exacerbate economic inequality; it's just what ends up happening because of how the tech industry functions structurally. Challenging this system requires tech workers to realise their interests lie with their class, not with their CEOs.**
