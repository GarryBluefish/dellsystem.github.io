On September 1, 2018, I spoke at [Derby Transformed](https://www.facebook.com/events/544102699319978/) on two panels: one about media bias, and an all-female panel on Corbyn's economic plans. The talks weren't recorded, and I only have very loose and free-form notes, which I've copied+pasted below.

## Panel on media reform

* social media companies are not killing journalism on their own - latent tendencies
	* deep links between surveillance model and modern capitalism
	* for-profit ad-funded journalism was always unsustainable
	* but the internet age heightened these contradictions
* US tech billionaries buying up publications (wapo, recently TIME) beacuse they can
	* they've become middlemen/gatekeepers, extracting revenue as rent
	* siphoning the cut of ad revenue that journalism would have gotten
	* solution is more public funding. the profit motive undermines the media's role in upholding democracy
	* ad-supported journalism was flawed from the outset
	* goog/fb: 50% of all digital advertising revenue in the UK. over 60% in US
	* google's digitial news initiative: 150 million euros in europe in 3 years. tiny compared to revenue - not enough
* tax them more to fund journalism, as Corbyn proposed recently? that's a start
	* but the important issue is ownership
	* the proposed state-run version of FB needs more discussion (have to grapple with the international elements)
	* these technologies allow transcending borders
* FB's bias is not the problem
	* the problem is that it has so much unelected and unaccountable power in the first place
	* we need to dispense with the "great man theory"-inflected perspective, and demand wider democratic accountability
	* instead of focusing on privacy, focus on control
	* the goal should be to kill off their business model but keep the (often useful) communication technology they offer
	* need to unbundle: separate tech's benefits (as a comms platform) from the drives of the corporation that currently owns it
	* nationalise, internationalise, whatever term you use - the goal is to take it out of the capital accumulation process
	* too big to fall under auspices/aegis of a single nation state
* need to make structural changes

## Panel on Corbynomics

* we have to see capitalism as a system
	* main drive: tendency of capital to accumulation
	* from that you can derive the rest
* neoliberal project was deliberately designed to benefit the few
	* as a result, it could be technocratic
	* our project can't
* to sketch out the contemporary economic landscape:
	* what is technology in a capitalist system?
	* apple, trillion dolar company
	* these companies have few employees, and huge cash hoards. rent extraction
* this is a fundamentally new situation, international in scope, scale of corporations never seen before
	* these companies own the digital infrastructure underpinning much of modern society, entwined with financialisation
* twin strands of neoliberalisation and globalisation
	* the corbyn project will have to deal with that
	* EU attempts to fine, tax, get small concessions - but not really substantially cutting power
	* one promising avenue: logistical choke points in these global value chains
	* the flipside of globalisation, that could be an avenue for resistance (solidarity extends beyond borders)
* we can't just (shouldn't just) replicate SV elsewhere
	* why is SV american anyway?
	* instead, take tech development out of the capital accumulation process
	* because digital technology supercharges capitalist tendencies
* we need to aim for silicon valley abolition
	* i.e., restructure society to get rid of this hierarchy that facilitates wealth concentration, rather than building equivalents elsewhere
	* we need a coordinated international projct, across national borders. including workers in the tech industry
	* the goal should be to share scientific/tech development with humanity
	* so we can steer it towards useful purposes (see mariana mazzucato's work here) rather than as IP locked up within a corporation
* conclude: this sounds radical now, but tech is not developed in a vacuum
	* there is a larger social/political landscape
	* as the balance of class forces changes (through labour struggles, electoral victories, judicial victories, community efforts)
	* so does the realm of possibility
	* truly radical options begin to look not only feasible but inevitable
* goal: economic democracy
	* affordability as a political question, linked to the question of fake wealth
