<p>I started writing on Medium in 2017 before I realised that writing for an actual publication was infinitely preferable (not least because you get an actual editor, and you sometimes even get paid). Some of these actually made quite a splash—most notably my Paul Graham one, and "What I wish I had known" to a lesser extent—but I would highly recommend to anyone thinking of writing on Medium to instead redirect their attention to actually existing publications.</p>
