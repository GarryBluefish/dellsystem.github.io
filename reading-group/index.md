title: "Jacobin reading group in London"
---

In January 2018, I started an informal [Jacobin reading group](https://www.jacobinmag.com/reading-groups), mostly consisting of fellow masters students at LSE. Since then, the group has expanded to include others, and I now co-host the group with [Hettie O'Brien](https://twitter.com/hettieveronica). We meet every 1-2 weeks (Thursday or Friday, usually) at one of several venues in central London from 6:30-8pm, and we usually have a guest speaker whose readings we'll have posted ahead of time.

### If you're interested in joining us

The goal of this whole thing is radical political education within a small network, while also building a bit of a community at the same time. Some of us go to the pub after the sessions, but that's obviously not a requirement. I started the group with people I knew who were in the same boat as me (in terms of being new to the left and wanting to catch up), but we've since expanded to include people within a variety of different political traditions within the left.

We're reaching the upper limits of capacity right now, but I'm always keen to get new contributors who would fit in well with the group. Send me a message via [FB/Twitter/email](/about) and I'll get back to you when I can!

### If you've been asked to speak

The environment is meant to be casual and more like a pub discussion than a lecture. We try not to get too academic/theoretical, though at least some grounding in theory is always good. No need to prepare a talk in advance - the facilitator (either myself, or whoever is leading that week's discussion) will ask questions and moderate.

If you've written articles that you'd like participants to read in order to frame the discussion, please send them over. We'd prefer 2-3 shorter articles (under 2000 words) written for contemporary left publications like Jacobin, New Socialist, Novara, Red Pepper, etc, but can be flexible. Podcasts are good too!

### May 31: Me

Didn't have time to get a speaker so I just pontificated about how awful Silicon Valley is (by this point, I hadn't yet stumbled upon the idea of "abolition"). I mostly read excerpts from Corey Pein's book _Live Work Work Work Die: A Journey Into the Savage Heart of Silicon Valley_ and talked about my own experience in tech (which I've written about for Notes From Below: [Silicon Inquiry](http://www.notesfrombelow.org/article/silicon-inquiry)).

If you're curious about the book, here's some recommended reading/audio:
