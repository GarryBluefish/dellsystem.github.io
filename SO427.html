<p>This is <em>the</em> critical theory class to take at LSE, covering Adorno, Benjamin, Foucault, and Baudrillard. Highly recommended for theory fans. There's no auditingâ€”you'll have to actually take it, so make sure to submit a good statement to maximise your chances of getting in. It's definitely a lot of work, but it's a very autonomous and creative type of work, with great readings and a free-form essay on a topic of your choice (no group projects).</p>

<h2>Essays</h2>

<p>I wrote two essays for this class: one formative (not assessed), and one summative (assessed). For the formative, I wrote a 2,500 word <a href="/pdfs/SO427-adorno.pdf">response paper to Adorno's Theses Against Occultism</a> (mark: 77). For the summative, I wrote a 5,000 word <a href="/pdfs/SO427-matrix.pdf">essay on The Matrix</a> drawing on Adorno and Baudrillard (mark: a slightly disappointing 65, though I don't disagree with the feedback).
