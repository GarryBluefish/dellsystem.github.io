<p>This <em>the</em> critical theory class to take at LSE, covering Adorno, Benjamin, Foucault, and Baudrillard. As of writing, I've only been to one seminar so far, but it's absolutely amazing and you gotta take if you have the chance (there's no auditing—you'll have to actually take it, and make sure to submit a good statement to maximise chances of getting in). It's definitely a lot of work, but it's a very autonomous and creative type of work, with great readings and a free-form essay on a topic of your choice—no group projects or anything similarly contrived.</p>
