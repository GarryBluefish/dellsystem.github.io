<p>This <em>the</em> critical theory class to take at LSE, covering Adorno, Benjamin, Foucault, and Baudrillard. As of writing, I've only been to one seminar so far, but it's absolutely amazing and you gotta take if you have the chance (there's no auditing—you'll have to actually take it, and make sure to submit a good statement to maximise chances of getting in). It's definitely a lot of work, but it's a very autonomous and creative type of work, with great readings and a free-form essay on a topic of your choice—no group projects or anything similarly contrived.</p>

<h2>Essays</h2>

<p>I wrote two essays for this class: one formative (not assessed), and one summative (assessed). For the formative, I wrote a 2,500 word <a href="/pdfs/SO427-adorno.pdf">response paper to Adorno's Theses Against Occultism</a> (mark: 77). For the summative, I wrote a 5,000 word <a href="/pdfs/SO427-matrix.pdf">essay on The Matrix</a> drawing on Adorno and Baudrillard (mark: a slightly disappointing 65, though I don't disagree with the feedback).
