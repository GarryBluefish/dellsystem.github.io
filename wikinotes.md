wikinotes
---------

[wikinotes](http://www.wikinotes.ca) is an unofficial wiki-based resource for courses offered at McGIll University. Initially created by [clarle](https://www.github.com/clarle) in the fall of 2010 and hosted at [scinotes.wikispot.org](http://scinotes.wikispot.org), it has since gained a TLD (www.wikinotes.ca) and is now hosted with [StableHost](http://www.stablehost.com) (a terrific host, incidentally). We provide lecture notes, solutions to past finals, guides on solving problems and more - all contributed by students themselves and constantly and ruthlessly peer-reviewed.

The site is powered by MediaWiki and although we encourage users to sign up, anonymous editing is enabled. Open Courses is available to anyone, free of charge and advertisement-free. There are no plans to monetise the site in the near future, although I have hatched plans to move it away from PHP and make it a whole lot better in the process. The jury's still out on how long that will take, but hey, it's happening.

For more information, contact admin@wikinotes.ca.

You can view our side projects [on github](https://www.github.com/wikinotes) (of course).
