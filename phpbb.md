I am no longer actively developing any of my phpBB MODifications, all of which
were developed for phpBB 3.0x and haven't been ported over to 3.1x. Feel free
to [send me an email][contact] if you have support questions or are interested
in taking over development.

## Dynamic Avatar

{::nomarkdown}
{% include phpbb-download.html repo="waldo" %}
{:/nomarkdown}

<img src="/img/phpbb/dynamo.png" class="leftfloat" />

This MOD provides the ability to personalise your avatar, using bodily features
and clothes that can be purchased or acquired. In the vein of 2.0x/3.0x MODs
like Live Avatar, Nulavatar, and [Camorea Suite][camorea].

## Where's Waldo

<img src="/img/phpbb/waldo.png" class="leftfloat" />

{::nomarkdown}
{% include phpbb-download.html repo="waldo" %}
{:/nomarkdown}

A small image of Waldo (US) / Wally (UK) may appear somewhere on every page as
you browse the board. Inspired by [Xore's 2.x MOD CamelMOD][camelmod].

### Features

* The probability of appearance, mouseover text, hyperlink and the URL to the image are all adjustable through the ACP
* Integration with the [Ultimate Points MOD](http://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/ultimate_points), so that finding Waldo results in points
* Installable with AutoMOD
