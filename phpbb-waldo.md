A small image of Waldo \[US\] / Wally \[UK\] may appear somewhere on every page as you browse the board. Inspired by Xore's 2.x MOD CamelMOD.

**Features:**

*   The probability of finding Waldo on any page is adjustable through the ACP
*   The size of the area in which Waldo can appear is also adjustable
*   If you have the Ultimate Points MOD installed, you can set the number of points that will be awarded to a user that finds Waldo
*   You can set it so that clicking on the image of Waldo will lead you to another page (either within your domain or off-site)
*	Mouseover text and the URL to the image of Waldo are both adjustable through the ACP

**Planned features:**

*	The ability to select specific pages only where Waldo will appear (in conjunction with random feature)
*	A better way of defining the area in which Waldo can appear
*	ACP permissions
