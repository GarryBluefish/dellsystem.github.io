A small image of Waldo \[US\] / Wally \[UK\] may appear somewhere on every page as you browse the board. Inspired by Xore's 2.x MOD CamelMOD.

## Features

* The probability of appearance, mouseover text, hyperlink and the URL to the image are all adjustable through the ACP
* Integration with the [Ultimate Points MOD](http://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/ultimate_points), so that finding Waldo results in points
* Installable with AutoMOD

**Planned**:

* ACP permissions (issue #1)
* Ability to upload image via ACP (issue #2)
* Ability to cap amount of points earned in a time period (issue #3)
* Ability to enable/disable feature for guests/groups (issue #4)
* Ability to exclude or set pages on which Waldo can appear (issue #5)
* Ability to configure when points should be awarded (issue #6)
