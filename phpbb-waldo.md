A small image of Waldo [US] / Wally [UK] may appear somewhere on every page as you browse the board. Inspired by Xore's 2.x MOD CamelMOD.

*	Editable from the ACP
*	The probability of finding Waldo can be adjusted, as can the URL of the image of Waldo (although if you replace the image of Waldo with an image of something else, Waldo may be sad)
*	Others
