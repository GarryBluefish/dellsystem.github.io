<p>I wrote my 9,981-word dissertation on the political economy of Silicon Valley. I stupidly left all the actual writing to the ~4 days before it was due, so it's not quite as well-written as I'd like it to be, and I definitely cribbed some sentences from other things I've written, but at least it's done. I also quite like the ending, as cheesy as it is.</p>

<p>Here's the finished version as a PDF (after fixing a few typos that I only noticed way after the deadline, and reducing the margins/line spacing): <a href="/pdfs/dissertation.pdf">my extremely rushed dissertation</a>. I won't get feedback on it until November, but I promise to post it here when I get it, even if it's brutal.</p>

<p>I used my personal note-taking app, <a href="http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me">Bookmarker</a>, to keep track of quotes that could potentially be useful for my dissertation. You can see the full list of these quotes <a href="http://bookmarker.dellsystem.me/tag/dissertation/cite">here</a>.</p>
