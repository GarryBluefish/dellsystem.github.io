title: Fragments
---

An attempt at writing something new and unedited every day in 2019, as part of a New Year's resolution. Inspired partly by Mark Fisher's old blog ([k-punk](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/mark-fishers-k-punk-and-the-futures-that-have-never-arrived)).

To get notified of new posts, you can sign up for my [email
newsletter](https://dellsystem.substack.com/) which
