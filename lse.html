title: MSc Inequalities and Social Sciences at LSE
---

<p>
    Continuing my tradition of being <a href="http://wikinotes.ca">that one
    nerd who types up lecture notes for every class</a>, I'm posting my notes + essays for all the modules I'm taking as part of my masters degree (or just for personal edification). 
</p>
<p>
    The program is the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2018/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science">MSc Inequalities and Social Science</a>
    and it's part of LSE's <a
    href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities"> International
    Inequalities Institute</a>. You can read my personal statement (from my
    application last year) <a href="/posts/a-personal-statement">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm done with classes now, but behind on posting notes. Will get around to it at some point, maybe. I have mixed feelings about the program, to be
    honest; <a href="/about">contact me</a> if you want to know more.
