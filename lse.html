title: MSc Inequalities and Social Sciences at LSE
---

<p>
    Continuing my tradition of being <a href="http://wikinotes.ca">that one
    nerd who types up lecture notes for every class</a>, I'm posting notes + essays for the modules I took for my masters degree (or just for personal edification).
</p>
<p>
    The program is the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2018/MSc-Inequalities-and-Social-Science">MSc Inequalities and Social Science</a>
    and it's part of LSE's <a
    href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities"> International
    Inequalities Institute</a>. You can read my personal statement for it <a href="/posts/a-personal-statement">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I attended during the third year of the program (2017-2018), and the course has probably changed since then, so keep that in mind when reading my notes. In general, I'd recommend it for people who are interested in working in policy. For those who prefer theory, I'd suggest the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2020/MSc-Political-Sociology">political sociology</a> program instead. Feel free to email me (ilostwaldo at gmail) for more specific advice.
