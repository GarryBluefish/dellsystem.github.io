I like art - painting, sketching, and digital (i.e., drawing simple designs in
Inkscape). I'm not very good at improvising, though, so most of my works are
based on a photograph (CC-licensed or public domain where possible, but it
should fall under fair dealing in any case). I've tried to credit the original
source where possible, but some of the sources for my work are lost in the
browser bookmarks of laptops past. If you know the source for anything credited,
please [let me know!](/about#contact)

To see a higher-quality version of each thumbnail, just click on the photo (or
view the [imgur album][album], which also contains a couple more paintings which
didn't make the cut for this page). For the most part, the quality of the photos
is pretty bad. Unfortunately, I can't get any better-quality photos for most of
them &ndash; I no longer own the vast majority of my paintings, as I usually
give them away as gifts. In fact, for some of my paintings, I don't even have
photos of them at all.

<small>i guess they'll just be lost in time, like tears in rain</small>

## Paintings

### Swan

</a>

[Source: Wallpapers Wide][swan]. Acrylic on a 12" x 16" canvas from Deserres.
Completed on January 16, 2016 as a late Christmas gift.

This was the first time I tried drawing a grid and pencil-sketching the main
features within the grid before painting over it. It definitely helped with
getting the shape of the swan right. Kind of makes me feel dumb for not trying
this before.

[Source: Ben Grey on Flickr][butterfly]. Acrylic on a canvas of uncertain
dimensions from the dollar store. Completed on October 13, 2012 as a birthday
gift. As you can see, I really mangled the dimensions and colours for this one.

### Rose

### Flower

[Source: WallpapersWide][flower]. Acrylic on a 11" x 14" canvas from
DeSerres. Completed on December 23, 2011 as a Christmas gift.

The sad story behind this painting is that I thought the blue stuff behind the
flower (which is actually purple in the original photo, but I didn't have the
right shade of purple) was a rock. Turns out it was a log. When I look at the
original now, it's so obviously a log. I probably hit my head on a rock or
something.

Source: a graphic that I think I found on 4chan (don't judge). Acrylic on
scrapbook paper. Completed sometime in 2010 because I was feeling melancholy
that day. The photo quality is awful, I know.

uncertain size from the dollar store. Completed sometime in 2009. This photo
also has terrible quality. I'm sorry.

### Generic landscape

</a>

Source: no clue. Acrylic on a small canvas from the dollar store. Completed
sometime before 2009. The stuff on the sides is tape because I'm an idiot and
couldn't find a better way to stick the canvas onto the wall.

### Balloons

Source: original, for once. Acrylic on a tiny canvas from the dollar store.
Completed sometime before 2009. The stick figures were drawn with pen because
have you ever tried to draw stick figures with paint? It's not easy.

### Dewdrops

<a href="http://imgur.com/oi5KHqm">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oi5KHqml.jpg" class="large-thumb" />
</a>

Source: somewhere on Flickr (I've been trying to find the original for years but
I haven't been able to). Acrylic on a small canvas (I think 7" x 9") from the
dollar store. I think I painted this in December of 2008. This is widely (by
which I mean, among the few people I've shown this to) considered to be my
magnus opus, which is pretty sad if 1) you consider the fact that I painted this
almost 6 years ago (and thus clearly haven't really improved my craft since
then) and if 2) you notice all the places where I fucked up and was unable to
fix it. Like the purple smudge on the second dewdrop from the right. Or the
weird, nature-defying shape of the second dewdrop from the left.

This painting and I have a love-hate relationship. It's complicated.

[Source: Luz Adriana Villa on Flickr][moon]. Acrylic on a tiny canvas from the
dollar store. Completed sometime in 2008 or 2009. The colours are kind of washed
out compared to the original, and I'm not really sure why I decided to add
another bird. Also the moon looks like it's melting.

## Sketches

### Princess

<a href="http://imgur.com/riKJLG9">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/riKJLG9l.jpg?1" class="large-thumb" />
</a>

[Source: a Vera Wang Princess ad (featuring Camilla Belle)][princess] that I
found in some magazine. Pencil on a huge piece of paper, using grid lines for
guidance. Completed in early 2008 for an art class assignment because I'm a
massive overachiever and I was obsessed with Vera Wang at the time. I fucked up
one of the eyes, though, so looking at her face is kind of terrifying. On the
bright side, the ruffles in the clothing around her arms are incredibly
detailed! (Prioritising is hard)

## Digital

When I was in my senior year of high school, my friend and I created an
embarrassingly cheesy series of webcomics that could be described as
"xkcd-inspired, but with a focus on melodramatic teenage problems and
littered with inside jokes that will certainly seem dated in a few years' time"
(The New York Times).

(That's a joke. It was never featured in The New York Times.)

I had a lot of fun with it, going so far as to do all the graphics in Inkscape
and build a PHP-based website that was visited by a few dozen people throughout
its lifespan, all of whom were my friends and most of whom could relate to the
banal teenage problems featured. The website has since been deleted, for
reasons that can probably be surmised, but I still have the graphics, so I
figured I'd put the least embarrassing ones on here.

### Tales From Mathematics

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wOTGhZ6.png" />

This one was supposed to be part of a series featuring various abuses of
mathematics, but I only ever made one. You can tell I was salty about something
here.

### Ash and Pikachu

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/kgtXqbU.png" />

This one's actually one of my favourites &ndash; I really enjoyed making those vector
renditions of Pikachu and Waldo. Inspired by a true story, albeit one that does
not involve Pikachu, but does involve a healthy dose of salt.

### A Tale of Too Much Alcohol

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GTCI71S.png" />

Also inspired by a true story, or, more accurately, many true stories.

### Explorer

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QkLUAzw.png" />

A fun and unusually salt-free little drawing.

### Tales From Regular Physics

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/enBqA5c.png" />

There was supposed to be another series called "Tales From Astrophysics" but I
never ended up making it. There are only so many ways you can misappropriate
scientific concepts.

### Maybe It's Better

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MFXyD96.png" />

Presented without comment.

### Bad Ideas

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WLpgjcZ.png" />

The watermelon bowling thing happened to me while on a trip to a particularly
rural part of China. We managed to procure a whole watermelon but didn't have
anything to cut it open with, so we decided to forgo eating it and just use it
as a bowling ball instead (there was also not much to do in the area).
Evidently, the watermelon had other plans, so we were able to enjoy a nice
snack of watermelon after a brief attempt at bowling.

### Themed Names

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/H0NBRwY.png" />

Making this one taught me a lot about: precious gems, Switzerland, nuts, and the
depths of human cruelty.

### Paper Cranes

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CzMKcfF.png" />

The weird story about this one (which is one of the only ones not inspired
by a true story &ndash; the idea just came to me one day when I was making
paper cranes) is that about two years after I posted it, I found an
[everything2 writeup][cranes] with an eerily similar theme.

### Plenty of Fish

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jSYAZyR.png" />

I had to bury that fish in the garden myself. It was a sad day.

### Another Fish

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/A13VpvK.png" />

True story. There were a lot of fish turnover issues that year. My CEO approval
rating on Glassbowl went way down.
